Look, I'm tired of watching brilliant developers build amazing things that never make a penny.

You know the story. You spend six months crafting the perfect app. It's technically beautiful. The code is clean. The features are solid. But somehow... nobody pays for it. Sound familiar?

Here's what I've learned after watching (and living through) too many failed projects: we don't fail because we can't code. We fail because we don't know how to turn code into cash.

That's why Indie10k exists.

## What We're Actually Building

Right now, Indie10k helps you go from $0 to your first $1000 with daily tasks that actually matter. Not busy work. Not generic "build your audience" advice. Specific actions that move the needle on revenue.

But that's just the beginning.

We're building toward something small. Under the hood, that "one thing" runs on the TenK 6 methodology â€” a simple weekly loop with six universal primitives:

- List 5: expand your options before committing
- Pick 1: choose a direction and focus
- Ship 1: execute something real
- Ask 3: collect external feedback
- Measure 1: track one metric that matters
- Share 1: publish your learnings for accountability

Each step requires evidence (a link, screenshot, or metric) before the next unlocks. No endless planning, just measurable progress at your pace. You can complete multiple steps in a day or one a week â€” the weekly arc adapts to your rhythm.

We support multiple tracks so you always know what to do next:

- Validate: prove demand and fit
- Distribute: grow reach and channels
- Monetize: convert and price effectively
- Retain: reduce churn and increase value

## The Big Picture

Our vision is simple: to help indie developers reach MRR $10k who has limited time, budget and knowledge about growth.

Because here's the thingâ€”indie developers don't need another productivity app. They need a loop that helps them finish what they start, launch without overthinking, and actually win.

That's what we're building. One focused mission at a time. ðŸš€
