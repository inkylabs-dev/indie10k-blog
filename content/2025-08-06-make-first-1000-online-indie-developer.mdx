Your first $1,000 online feels impossible until it happens. Then you realize it's not about building the next unicornâ€”it's about solving small problems for real people.

Here are four paths that actually work for indie developers. Pick one, stick with it, and stop overthinking.

## 1. Write About What You Know (Blogging)

You already know stuff other developers want to learn. Turn that into content.

**How it works:** Write tutorials, guides, and honest reviews. People find you through Google. You make money from ads, sponsorships, or selling your own stuff.

- **Timeline:** 3-6 months to build meaningful traffic
- **First step:** Pick a specific niche you're passionate about
- **Reality check:** Writing consistently is harder than it looks

## 2. Build a Tiny SaaS That Does One Thing Well

Forget building the next Slack. Build something that solves one specific problem perfectly.

**How it works:** Find a small problem, build a minimal solution, charge monthly for it. Small problems add up to big revenue.

- **Timeline:** 2-4 months to $1k if you focus
- **First step:** Look for problems in communities where developers hang out
- **Reality check:** Marketing is harder than building

## 3. Teach What You've Learned (Online Courses)

Package your knowledge into something people can buy and consume at their own pace.

**How it works:** Create video lessons, PDFs, or workshops. Sell on Gumroad, Udemy, or your own site.

- **Timeline:** Can hit $1k in a single launch with the right audience
- **First step:** Survey your network about what they want to learn
- **Reality check:** Good teaching takes different skills than good coding

Make sure your course has a compelling [value proposition](/blog/2025-09-01-how-to-write-uvp-for-indie-projects) that clearly explains why someone should choose yours over the thousands of other programming courses.

## 4. Recommend Stuff You Already Use (Affiliate Marketing)

You probably already recommend tools to other developers. Why not get paid for it?

**How it works:** Write honest reviews and comparisons. Include affiliate links. Get paid when people sign up.

- **Timeline:** Slower growth but steady income once articles rank
- **First step:** List the tools you actually use and love
- **Reality check:** Trust is everything. Recommend bad stuff and you're done

## Which Path Should You Choose?

Stop trying to pick the "best" one. They're all good if you execute well.

Love writing? Blog. Love building? Make a SaaS. Love teaching? Create courses. Love evaluating tools? Try affiliate marketing.

Most successful indie developers eventually combine multiple approaches.

## The Real Secret

Making your first $1,000 isn't about having the perfect idea. It's about:

1. **Starting with your existing knowledge**
2. **Focusing on one approach**
3. **Being consistent for months, not weeks**
4. **Actually launching instead of perfecting**

**Your next step:** Pick one method above and commit to shipping something in the next 30 days.
