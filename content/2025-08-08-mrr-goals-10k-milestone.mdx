Ten thousand dollars per month. In the indie hacker world, that number has become shorthand for "you made it."

But why $10k? And is it actually achievable, or just aspirational goal-setting that makes people feel bad about their $200/month side projects?

## Why $10k Became *The* Number

It wasn't arbitrary. Ten thousand dollars monthly recurring revenue represents something real:

**Freedom from the day job.** In most places, $10k covers rent, food, and basic living expenses with some left over. You're not rich, but you're independent.

**Proof of concept.** Getting to $10k usually means you have hundreds of paying customers. That's validation that you're solving a real problem people will pay for.

**Predictable income.** Monthly recurring revenue is different from one-time sales. You can plan, invest, and sleep better when you know roughly what's coming in next month.

## The Math That Makes It Feel Possible

Here's why $10k MRR isn't just a pipe dream:

- 100 customers paying $100/month
- 200 customers paying $50/month  
- 500 customers paying $20/month
- 1,000 customers paying $10/month

See? You don't need millions of users. You need a focused group of people who find real value in what you're building. Use our [Profitability Path Tool](/tools/profitability-path) to visualize exactly how many customers you need at different price points to reach your MRR goals.

## The Path to $10k (Reality Version)

**Start stupidly small.** Your first goal isn't $10kâ€”it's $1. Then $10. Then $100. Each milestone teaches you something different about your market and your product.

**Focus on one thing.** Pick one product, one market, one problem. Get really good at solving it before you try to solve everything else.

**Distribution is everything.** Building is the easy part. Getting people to find, trust, and pay for your thing? That's where most people fail. Our [Traffic to MRR Path Tool](/tools/traffic-mrr-path) shows you how website traffic converts to actual revenue at different stages.

**Keep customers happy.** In MRR businesses, losing existing customers is way more expensive than getting new ones. Retention matters more than acquisition.

## Why Some People Never Get There

**They never start.** They read about other people hitting $10k but never ship anything themselves.

**They give up too early.** MRR growth is slow at first. Going from $0 to $100 takes longer than going from $1000 to $2000.

**They optimize for the wrong metrics.** Chasing users instead of revenue. Focusing on features instead of marketing. Building for themselves instead of their customers.

**They spread too thin.** Trying to build five different products instead of making one really good.

## Is $10k Actually Special?

Honestly? Not really. Some people need more to feel secure. Others are happy with less. The number itself isn't magic.

What's special is having enough recurring income to make choices based on what you want to do, not what you have to do. For some people that's $3k. For others it's $20k.

But $10k has become a rallying point. A shared goal that gives the indie community something concrete to aim for.

## Your Real Next Step

Forget $10k for now. Focus on your first $100 in monthly recurring revenue. Once you have that, focus on $500. Then $1000.

Each milestone teaches you something different. And before you know it, $10k stops feeling impossible and starts feeling inevitable.
