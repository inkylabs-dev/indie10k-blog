Most indie developers donâ€™t fail because of bad code.

They fail because they donâ€™t have a **clear roadmap**, lose consistency, or get overwhelmed by the business side.

Thatâ€™s the problem Indie10k solves.

### What it is

Indie10k is your **AI Coach** for indie development. Instead of guessing what to do next, you get a step-by-step plan that guides you from **$0 â†’ $1k â†’ $10k MRR**.

### How it works

- 

ðŸŽ¯ **Daily Missions** â€” Actionable, bite-sized tasks that compound into real growth.

- 

ðŸ§­ **Strategy Check-In (weekly)** â€” A lightweight review that summarizes your momentum and adjusts next weekâ€™s missionsâ€”no heavy logging.

- 

ðŸš€ **Progress Dashboard** â€” Visual insights into your journey from $0 to $10k.

Show up, execute, and let the system keep you on track.

### Why it matters

No more guessing or spinning your wheelsâ€”just a clear, adaptive path to $10k MRR.
