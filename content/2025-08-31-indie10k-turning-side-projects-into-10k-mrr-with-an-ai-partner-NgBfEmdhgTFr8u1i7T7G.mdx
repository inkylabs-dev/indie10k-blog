**Hey IH ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m working on something new: Indie10k**

Iâ€™ve been shipping projects for a while, but one thing Iâ€™ve noticed: indie devs rarely fail because they canâ€™t build. We fail because we lose focus, second-guess ourselves, and donâ€™t have a clear path to get from *idea â†’ income*.

So Iâ€™m building **Indie10k**. Itâ€™s an AI coach that helps indie developers stay on track toward $10k MRR. Instead of trying to figure out everything yourself, you get weekly check-ins, strategy guidance, and momentum tracking. The goal: less guessing, more executing.

Right now itâ€™s super earlyâ€”no Stripe integration, just a barebones product for early beta users. But if youâ€™re working on a side project and want a partner to keep you accountable, Iâ€™d love for you to give it a try.
