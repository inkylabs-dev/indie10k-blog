Today was a solid day.

- 
Press release is out 🎉
The first PR went live:
[https://www.prlog.org/13096861-indie10k-launches-ai-coaching-platform-to-help-indie-developers-reach-10k-mrr.html](https://www.prlog.org/13096861-indie10k-launches-ai-coaching-platform-to-help-indie-developers-reach-10k-mrr.html)

It feels a bit surreal seeing Indie10k written up like that.

- 
Analytics are in 📊
Hooked up GA. Day one traffic:

- 
28 unique visitors

- 
4 people joined the waitlist

Small numbers, but hey, those are real humans coming in. It’s motivating.

- 
Prototype is live 🌐
Finally pushed from local to production. It’s rough, but working. And I’m using it myself.

The fun part: all three of these tasks came directly from Indie10k’s AI Coach. It told me to ship the PR, track analytics, and get the prototype out of [localhost](http://localhost).

So yeah, I’m literally dogfooding Indie10k. Building the thing, while being coached by the thing. Very meta.

How do you all feel about using your own product this way? Does it help you see the gaps more clearly?

BTW, I am launching a beta testing campaign. 👉 join waitlist if you want to use it for free during the testing period: [https://indie10k.com/?utm_source=ih&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ih_daily](https://indie10k.com/?utm_source=prlog&amp;utm_medium=press&amp;utm_campaign=press_release)
