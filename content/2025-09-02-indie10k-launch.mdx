## We Built an AI Coach for Indie Developers Who Can't Stay Focused (aka All of Us)

_September 2, 2025_ 

Alright, let's be honest. **Indie10k** exists because I kept building cool stuff that made exactly $0. Sound familiar?

We're developers. We can build anything. The problem? We get distracted by the next shiny feature while our revenue stays firmly planted at zero. And don't even get me started on all those "just do marketing" articles that assume you have six months and a team.

So I built something different. An AI coach that doesn't overwhelm you with a hundred strategies—it just gives you one thing to focus on each week.

Here's what makes it weird (in a good way):

- **Weekly reality checks**: Not daily overwhelm, not monthly "oops I forgot"—just weekly nudges that keep you moving  
- **One mission at a time**: Because your brain can only handle so much while you're still building  
- **Built for solos**: No enterprise BS, no team features you'll never use  
- **Actual revenue focus**: Every mission points toward making money, not just "engagement"  

Here's the thing—most indie projects don't fail because they suck. They fail because we never figure out the business side. We're great at shipping code, terrible at shipping revenue. That's [why most side projects fail](/blog/2025-08-07-why-most-side-projects-fail)—not from bad code, but from never finding product-market fit.

"I've watched too many brilliant developers build amazing things that nobody pays for," said Ju Lin (that's me), founder of Indie10k. "This tool is basically the business cofounder I wish I'd had three failed projects ago."  

We're in early beta right now, which means it's rough around the edges but it works. Join the waitlist at [indie10k.com](https://indie10k.com) if you're tired of building in the void.

## About This Whole Thing

Indie10k is what happens when a developer gets tired of building stuff nobody pays for. It's a project by Inkylabs Limited, and yeah, we're indie too—so we get it.
