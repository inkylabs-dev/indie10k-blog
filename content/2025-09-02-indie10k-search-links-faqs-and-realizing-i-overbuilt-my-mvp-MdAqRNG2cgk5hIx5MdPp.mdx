Small but meaningful progress today 🚀

- 
**Search is live**
You can now search missions by keywords. Makes it way easier to dig up old missions instead of scrolling endlessly.

- 
**Mission Links**
Probably my favorite addition so far. You can now attach any number of links to a mission — Notion docs, ChatGPT convos, Figma, Google Docs, whatever. I’ve been tempted to chase other shiny features, but this one feels core. Indie10k should stay focused on *missions*, not become feature-bloated. Links let the rest of your tool stack plug in without me reinventing the wheel.

- 
**Mission FAQ**
Each mission now comes with AI-generated FAQs. Basically “starter questions” to inspire action when you’re stuck. (Sometimes just seeing “What’s the next small step?” is enough to get moving.) To keep it small, the questions simply direct user to ChatGPT.

- 
**Pro Plan Teaser**
System now shows “Pro Plan is coming” — mainly to set expectations with beta users that it won’t stay free forever.

💭 Reflection:
I think I may have overbuilt the MVP. Should have reached out to seed users earlier instead of tinkering with features. Tomorrow’s focus: finally learn how to bring in those first testers and start the feedback loop.
