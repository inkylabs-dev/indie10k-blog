Iâ€™m submitting Indie10k to 100+ AI directories â€” tracking what works (and what doesnâ€™t), and built a free AI directory tracker tool for that: ðŸ‘‰ [https://indie10k.com/tools/directory-tracker](https://indie10k.com/tools/directory-tracker)

Hey IH!

Iâ€™ve been running an ongoing experiment: submitting Indie10k to as many AI tool directories as I can find â€” 100+ at this point â€” to see if the backlinks and visibility are actually worth it.

Itâ€™s still early, but hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m noticing so far:

â€¢	Top-tier directories (like [Toolify.AI](http://Toolify.AI), Futurepedia, FutureTools, SaaS AI Tools) feel solid â€” they send some traffic and the backlinks look good.

â€¢	Mid-tier directories (TAAFT, All Things AI, Easy With AI) are a mixed bag, but still worth it for credibility.

â€¢	Long tail directoriesâ€¦ hit-or-miss. Some accept instantly, others ghost you, and a bunch look like zombie sites.

Instead of doing this blindly, I started tracking every submission. Which got me thinking â€” maybe other founders would want the same. So I hacked together a simple tracker tool (still scrappy) that lets you:

â€¢	See a preloaded list of directories.

â€¢	Mark where youâ€™ve submitted / been approved.

â€¢	Track progress and export if needed.

I also wrote a blog post where Iâ€™m documenting the whole process and keeping notes on what works:

Meanwhile I built a free AI Directory tracker tool to help me track the progress: ðŸ‘‰  [https://indie10k.com/tools/directory-tracker](https://indie10k.com/tools/directory-tracker)
