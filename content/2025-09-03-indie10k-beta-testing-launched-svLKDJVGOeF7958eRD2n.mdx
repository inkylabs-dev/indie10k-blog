Today was a mix of experiments and small wins:

- 
Built a beta invite system, but ended up reverting it. It introduced a nasty bug I couldnâ€™t easily fix, and with only a handful of testers, a simple environment variable allowlist works better.

- 
Sent out the first batch of invitesâ€”four beta testers are now in!

- 
Started backlink building for the app. Submitted Indie10k to five AI tools directories.

- 
Polished up several blog posts with better writing and interlinks for on-page SEO.

- 
Enhanced the landing pageâ€”added some illustrations in a neubrutalist style (still not sure if that was worth the time, but it looks fun).
