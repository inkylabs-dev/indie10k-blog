Dogfooding hurts. I thought I was building a tool for indie devs, but when I ran Indie10k on myself last week, it felt like homework. Twenty giant missions stacked into a week, strategy check-ins... I wasn‚Äôt building momentum, I was down in the rabbit hole - each mission yielded to lots of homework and even more subtasks. I mean, they are not wrong, each obviously leads to growth but it is just too much.

So I tore it down. Two long nights with ChatGPT (arguing from first principles like we were trying to reinvent the wheel) and a little Claude Code magic later, I had something new. A pivot in 48 hours.
## Work Backwards From the Invariant

The invariant doesn‚Äôt change: **help indie devs hit profitable cash flow faster, with limited time and budget.**

And honestly, only six levers really matter:

1. Does the idea even sniff product/market fit?

2. Can you get qualified traffic (volume √ó intent)?

3. Do people activate and convert?

4. Do they pay enough (ARPU / LTV)?

5. Do they stick around (retention)?

6. Can you iterate fast enough (cycle time)?

Everything else? Just noise.
## Reduce to the Core Loop

At the core, building looks like this:

**Hypothesis ‚Üí Ship ‚Üí Distribute ‚Üí Measure ‚Üí Decide.**

And to run that loop, you don‚Äôt need a whole playbook of rituals. You need three things, max:

- **Next Best Action (NBA):** what‚Äôs the one thing I should do right now?

- **Evidence Log:** how do I know I actually did it, and what happened?

- **Weekly Check-in:** based on evidence, what‚Äôs the next experiment?

That‚Äôs it. The rest is bloat.
## Question the Pillars

**AI Coach**

Developers don‚Äôt need a chat buddy. We already have ChatGPT. We need fewer wrong turns.

- Keep: a micro-coach that answers just two things:

1. What‚Äôs next?

2. How do I know it‚Äôs done?

- Cut: long chats, fake personas, emotional pep talks.

**AI-Generated Missions**

The truth? Nobody reads walls of AI text.

- Keep: a tiny library of battle-tested playbooks (SEO links, waitlist boosts, conversion lifts). Let AI adapt them to context.

- Cut: sprawling trees of tasks. Each ‚ÄúAction Card‚Äù should take ‚â§ 30 minutes.

**Momentum**

Building is a behavioral game. If rhythm breaks, people quit.

- Keep: daily Action Cards (check them off, feel progress). One Metric Sprint per week (stay focused). Optional community nudge.

- Cut: gamified system, elaborate point systems.
## A Simpler, Better Model

**Core Mechanics**

1. **One Metric Sprint (OMS):** one metric per week. Traffic, signups, conversion‚Äîpick one.

2. **Action Cards:** 1‚Äì3 per day. Each with:

- Why (which lever it moves)

- What (‚â§ 3 steps)

- DoD (definition of done)

- Metric to watch

- Evidence slot (screenshot/link/number)

3. **Evidence Library:** your personal archive of what works (and what doesn‚Äôt).

And here‚Äôs the **Rule Score** I‚Äôve been testing to rank actions:

Score = Impact (1‚Äì3) √ó Alignment (0‚Äì1) √ó Evidence Weight √∑ Estimated Time (hours)

If it scores high, it‚Äôs worth doing. If it doesn‚Äôt, kill it.
## Before vs After

**Before:**

- 20+ missions per week

- Endless homework and subtasks that cannot be done in a short term

- Felt like PM software disguised as progress

**After:**

- 3 Action Cards per day

- 1 weekly metric to anchor focus

- Evidence log + Rule Score ‚Üí a system that‚Äôs light enough to actually use
## Why It Works

It cuts decision fatigue. It trims away the fluff. It turns your week into a rhythm instead of a burden. And maybe the most important thing‚Äîit forces you to build your own evidence-driven playbook over time. No guru required.
