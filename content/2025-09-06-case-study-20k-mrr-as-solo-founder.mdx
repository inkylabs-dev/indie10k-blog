### Introduction

This case study examines how the solo founder [@aginext](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1muz5bq/solo_founder_20k_mrr_zero_ads_zero_employees/) scaled a SaaS product to **$20K MRR** with **no ads, no employees, and zero paid marketing spend**. Instead, growth came from rapid customer feedback, evergreen content, and hyper-personal engagement.

Each strategy below is broken into a **30-minute Indie10k Action Card** so you can immediately apply the lessons in your own journey. The founder’s story is included as context for why each card worked in practice.

----------

## Action Card 1: Set Up Google Alerts

**Why This Matters**  
Catching conversations about your niche lets you join in early and drive signups.

**Action Steps**

1.  Go to Google Alerts.
    
2.  Add your top 3 competitor names + “alternative.”
    
3.  Choose “As-it-happens” and send to your inbox.
    

**Metric Impact**: referral_traffic

**Case Study Context**  
The founder set keyword alerts across multiple platforms—Twitter, Reddit, Indie Hackers, forums—and responded within minutes for six straight months. This created the illusion of being “everywhere at once,” even though he was operating completely solo.

----------

## Action Card 2: Create a Twitter/Reddit Keyword Search

**Why This Matters**  
Real-time engagement makes you look “everywhere at once.”

**Action Steps**

1.  On Twitter, save a search for `[keyword] SaaS`.
    
2.  On Reddit, subscribe to 2–3 relevant subreddits.
    
3.  Respond thoughtfully to 1 post today.
    

**Metric Impact**: social_engagement

**Case Study Context**  
By jumping into conversations almost instantly, he built credibility and trust. Users assumed there was a team behind the account, but in reality it was just one founder monitoring alerts and replying quickly.

----------

## Action Card 3: Schedule One Customer Zoom Call

**Why This Matters**  
Direct conversations create loyalty and reveal instant feature ideas.

**Action Steps**

1.  Send 3 invites using Cal.com or Calendly.
    
2.  Ask one question: _“What’s your #1 frustration with [problem]?”_
    
3.  Write down 2–3 takeaways.
    

**Metric Impact**: customer_feedback

**Case Study Context**  
The founder stopped using a 12-month roadmap and instead built directly from customer calls. In one live session, he shipped a feature while still on Zoom with the user—earning six new referrals that same month.

----------

## Action Card 4: Write a Mini Blog Post (300 words)

**Why This Matters**  
Evergreen posts compound traffic even if short and tactical.

**Action Steps**

1.  Pick one FAQ (e.g. “Export CSV from X”).
    
2.  Write a 300-word guide with screenshots.
    
3.  Publish on your blog.
    

**Metric Impact**: organic_traffic

**Case Study Context**  
He published over 200 highly targeted blog posts, each answering niche, intent-driven queries. Posts like “how to export CSV from [competitor]” brought in ~50 consistent signups every month, with no ongoing promotion needed.

----------

## Action Card 5: Draft a Competitor Comparison Page

**Why This Matters**  
Users actively search for “[competitor] vs [you].”

**Action Steps**

1.  Create a Google Doc with 2 columns: Competitor vs You.
    
2.  Add 3 clear differences.
    
3.  Save for publishing later.
    

**Metric Impact**: competitor_conversion

**Case Study Context**  
The founder set Google Alerts for competitor keywords, built “alternative” landing pages, and published migration guides. He also engaged directly in competitor support groups, often winning customers by simply helping them migrate. Over 40% of his MRR came from competitor refugees.

----------

## Action Card 6: Record a 2-Minute Loom for a New Signup

**Why This Matters**  
Personalized onboarding reduces churn and feels premium.

**Action Steps**

1.  Open Loom, record your screen.
    
2.  Say: _“Hi [Name], here’s how to get started with [your app].”_
    
3.  Send via email.
    

**Metric Impact**: activation_rate

**Case Study Context**  
Every new signup got a personal Loom onboarding video. Customers often replied with appreciation, and this personal touch set him apart from bigger, faceless competitors. Even users whose feature requests were declined received a follow-up Loom explaining why.

----------

## Action Card 7: Test a Pricing Page Update

**Why This Matters**  
Small pricing shifts help you gauge willingness to pay.

**Action Steps**

1.  Duplicate your pricing page.
    
2.  Increase one tier by 20%.
    
3.  Track signups for 1 week.
    

**Metric Impact**: MRR_growth

**Case Study Context**  
The founder raised prices by 5x in one move. Although 80% of customers churned, revenue doubled overnight. Even more surprisingly, support load dropped from 20 hours a week to just 2, because higher-value customers required far less hand-holding.

----------

## Action Card 8: Email One Churned User

**Why This Matters**  
Direct outreach often reveals the real cause of churn.

**Action Steps**

1.  Open your churn list.
    
2.  Pick 1 person.
    
3.  Send: _“Hey [Name], I saw you left. What could we have done better?”_
    

**Metric Impact**: churn_insights

**Case Study Context**  
The founder personally emailed churned users and sometimes won them back. Even when he didn’t, he gathered valuable product insights. This level of 1:1 care is nearly impossible for larger teams to replicate at scale.

----------

## Action Card 9: Map Your Daily Routine

**Why This Matters**  
A clear rhythm helps you avoid chaos as a solo founder.

**Action Steps**

1.  Open Notion/Google Doc.
    
2.  Write: _Morning – Social responses, Afternoon – Customer call, Evening – Blog._
    
3.  Stick to it for one day.
    

**Metric Impact**: consistency_score

**Case Study Context**  
His daily routine was simple: mornings for social + Looms, afternoons for a customer call and feature build, evenings for content. This routine required no employees, no automation, and cost $0 to run.

----------

## Action Card 10: Block Time for Rest

**Why This Matters**  
Protecting downtime ensures you don’t burn out.

**Action Steps**

1.  Add a calendar block called “Off – No Work.”
    
2.  Pick a weekend slot.
    
3.  Commit to it.
    

**Metric Impact**: founder_sustainability

**Case Study Context**  
The founder surfed twice a week, took weekends off, and even traveled to Japan for three weeks while revenue continued to grow. This balance proved the business was resilient without constant hustle.

----------

### Final Note

This solo founder’s journey demonstrates that **rapid action, personal customer care, and compounding assets** can outperform paid ads and big teams. By following these 30-minute cards, you can start building the same sustainable foundation on your path to **$10K MRR**.
