From what I’ve seen, most indie builders hit this wall: building is fun, but distribution feels like pushing a boulder uphill. The things that seem to work (slowly, but surely):

- 
**Writing posts that answer real questions people search for**, then sharing them in relevant spaces.

- 
**Picking one or two channels and committing**. (For me, X + IndieHackers feel right. Trying to “be everywhere” spreads me too thin.)

- 
**Submitting to directories/tool lists**. It’s not glamorous, but the backlinks + trickle of traffic help.

- 
**Talking directly to potential users**. Some of the best feedback and even first paying customers come from DMs and small forums.

It’s weird — you don’t need a big spike, just **enough of these small wins** stacking to feel momentum.

Curious: for those of you who’ve broken past the “nobody finds it” phase, what was the one channel or tactic that actually got traction for you?
