Ten days ago, It all started with an afternoon casual chat with ChatGPT. I was brainstorming backlinks, but that simple conversation made me think: *what if this could benefit all other indie devs?*

I wanted to solve a forever pain for indie devs: *I can build, but I don’t know growth.* How many side projects die for that exact reason? Too many.

Our goal with Indie10k is simple but ambitious: **help indie developers reach profitable cash flow faster, with limited time and budget.**

The approach? Nothing fancy. You still need hard work , consistent and patience. The rest is where Indie10k comes in—making you accountable, removing uncertainty, and guiding you through well-proven growth playbooks tailored to your unique project with the help of AI.

With Claude Code and ChatGPT, we hacked together the first prototype. I dogfooded it for a week, and it was… great. Except I tried to pack dozens of 30-day missions into one week. Predictably, chaos.

So, I re-invented the entire prototype. After long first-principles chats with ChatGPT, we found a simpler approach: let indie devs focus on **three daily bite-sized tasks**. That’s it. Doable, repeatable, momentum-building.

Then today, after 167 git commits, I accidentally bumped the version to **1.0.0**. At first I thought, “Oops.” But actually, it feels right. It feels greater.

Because this isn’t just another version bump. This is D-DAY for Indie10k: **we’re opening to public beta testing.**

I expect 0 testers today. And that’s okay. Because I’m positive about the next 6 months. I’ll use the exact Indie10k strategy—dogfooding again—to grow signups and, eventually, payments.

Let’s see where this wheel takes us. 🚀
