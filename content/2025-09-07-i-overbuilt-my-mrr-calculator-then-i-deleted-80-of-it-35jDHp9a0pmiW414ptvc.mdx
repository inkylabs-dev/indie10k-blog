I set out to build an “MRR calculator” for Indie10k.
Version 0 looked impressive: CAC, LTV, NRR, GRR, expansion, contraction, plan mix, annual prepay normalization, dunning recovery… you name it.

It also felt… wrong.

Not because the math was bad, but because **nobody early-stage needs a cockpit of switches** to answer the only questions indie founders actually care about:

- 
*How many users do I need?*

- 
*How long until I hit $1k → $10k MRR (aka ramen profitability → quit-job money)?*

So I scrapped it and started again.
## The moment I realized I’d built the wrong thing

I asked myself (first principles style):
“If I could only keep **three inputs**, what would they be?”

I wrote down:

- 
**Plan price ($/mo)**

- 
**New users per month**

- 
**Churn %** (optional, because most early projects don’t even know it yet)

Everything else was either noise, investor-grade, or premature.
## The core algorithm (nothing fancy)

`New MRR   = NewUsers × PlanPrice Churn MRR = CurrentMRR × ChurnRate MRR_next  = CurrentMRR + NewMRR − ChurnMRR `

Run that month over month, and you get **time to $1k/$5k/$10k** and **users required**.
That’s the whole point.
## What I deleted (and why)

- 
❌ Multi-plan pricing &amp; ARPA blending — great for boards, overkill for day 0.

- 
❌ CAC/LTV/NRR/ARR tiles — useful later; they obscured the one thing people want now.

- 
❌ Cohorts &amp; seasonality — I was cosplaying a data team, not serving indies.

- 
❌ CSV import &amp; dunning — fun, but yak-shave territory for an MVP.

**What stayed:**

- 
✅ Three sliders + one goal

- 
✅ Milestone timeline ($100 → $1k → $10k)

- 
✅ A clean growth curve with milestone markers

- 
✅ One-click “turn this into a mission” for Indie10k users (numbers → action)

## Example that made it “click”

- 
Plan: **$19/mo**

- 
New users: **10/mo**

- 
Churn: **3%/mo**

The tool says: **$1k in ~7 months**, **$10k in ~28 months**.

Not perfect. But **directionally true** and instantly motivating.
## Why this is better (for indies)

- 
**Clarity &gt; completeness.** You don’t need 20 dials to start.

- 
**Momentum &gt; metrics.** Seeing a date on the horizon changes how you work this week.

- 
**Action &gt; analysis.** The projection turns into a concrete Indie10k mission, not just a screenshot.

I’ll be in the comments answering Qs and collecting blunt feedback. If this helps you see your path to $1k, I’d love to hear it.
