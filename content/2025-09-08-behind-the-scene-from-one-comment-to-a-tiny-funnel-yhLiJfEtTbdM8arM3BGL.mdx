Somebody left me this comment on my last tool:

“This is a great tool, is it possible to also include lifetime subscriptions, monthly visitors, bounce rate if possible… other than that it’s really a solid tool.”

At first, my brain was like: *yes, add all the knobs!*
Lifetime toggle! Bounce slider! Visitor types dropdown!
And then I realized… I was about to build a **spreadsheets-from-hell simulator** instead of something people actually touch.
## The “aha” moment

I scribbled the funnel on a sticky note:

**Traffic → Signups → Paid → New MRR → Steady-State**

That’s it. Five boxes. Five dials. If you can’t explain your model in one napkin sketch, you’re doomed.

So I asked: *Do lifetime subs really need their own input?* Nope, that’s just ARPU smoothed over 12 months.
*Do I need bounce rate?* Nah, signup rate already tattles on your bounce.
*Monthly visitors?* That’s just daily traffic × 30. Extra button = extra confusion.

Rule of thumb I kept repeating: **if two inputs always multiply together, kill one.**
## Defaults &gt; paralysis

Most people don’t even know their signup or pay rates, so I baked in “don’t-embarrass-yourself” defaults:

- 
Signup rate: ~8% (slider range 5–10%)

- 
Pay rate: ~12% (slider range 5–20%)

- 
Net churn: 4% (because churn is the silent killer)

- 
ARPU: pick a round dollar, done

And if you *do* know your signups/day, flip a toggle and skip the signup slider. Simple enough that you don’t need to ask in the comments.
## The fun parts

- 
**Step Path UI**: big boxes, big numbers, arrows → it literally looks like the funnel we all draw on napkins.

- 
**Target helper**: type your dream MRR, it tells you how much traffic you actually need. (Prepare to cry.)

- 
**Bottleneck detector**: highlights if your signup or pay rate is the weakest link.

- 
**Presets**: Lean / Average / Aggressive. (Basically “me right now” vs. “me in my pitch deck.”)

Math under the hood is laughably tiny:
`\nnewMRR = (traffic × 30 × signupRate × payRate) × ARPU\nsteady = newMRR / churn\n`\nThat’s literally the whole thing.
## Shipping it

I nearly added an “advanced metrics” panel (cohort charts, lifetime toggles, blah blah) but forced myself to hit publish first.

Reactions?

- 
“Now I actually see where I’m leaking.”

- 
“Didn’t know my rates, used defaults, still useful.”

- 
“The traffic needed for $10k MRR hurt my feelings but thanks.”

Which is exactly the vibe I was going for. Brutal honesty, minimal pain.
## Takeaways

- 
**More knobs ≠ more clarity.**

- 
**One bottleneck is better than 20 dashboards.**

- 
**Ship the napkin version first.**

The comment that could drag me into feature creep actually gave me the best constraint: **keep it tiny, keep it shippable.**
