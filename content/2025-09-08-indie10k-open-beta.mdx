## 🔍 What Indie10k Is (and Isn’t)

Indie10k is **the growth gym for indie devs**. It helps you focus on the few things that actually move the needle—traffic, conversion, retention, iteration—and gives you daily actionable tasks to keep making progress.


It’s not yet another project management tool.
* It has no complexity to add to indie devs, who have lots of things to deal with.
* It simply asks you to complete three little actions each day, and over time, you will ride on a flying wheel.

It’s not a lengthy AI chat buddy that gives you walls of advice.
* It has a set of well-proven growth playbooks that can be optimized for your project.
* The AI coach makes dedicated, actionable tasks for you—not 10-hour research homework.

Think of Indie10k as your guide and coach—helping you build in public, grow step by step, and aim toward $10k MRR (or whatever your personal milestone may be).
