Ever log in, stare at your dashboard, and—yep, tumbleweeds. No signups. No traffic. Just you, your empty graph, and maybe a half-eaten snack. (We’ve all been there. It’s a vibe, but not a good one.)

So, here’s a wild idea: what if you stopped counting ghosts and started stacking wins?

Instead of mumbling, “I have no users,” try this on for size: “Today I’ll publish something actually useful. And I’ll toss it out to five places.”

That tiny move? It’s sneaky powerful:
- You get a blog post that ages like fine wine (or at least, not like milk).
- You own a backlink. Feels good.
- You show up on X, LinkedIn, Reddit, Indie Hackers, or wherever your people lurk.
- You get a little dopamine hit. Progress! Not just existential dread.

Here’s the secret: **Distribution isn’t magic. It’s a habit.**

## Make It a System (Because Motivation Is Flaky)

Knowing what to do? Easy. Actually doing it? Oof. That’s why I built [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com)—because I needed a nudge, too.

Indie10k hands you **action cards**. Bite-sized tasks. No “change the world” nonsense. Just stuff that moves the needle, one click at a time.

Instead of “I need more traffic,” you get something like:

**“Write a 700-word blog answering "How to Generate Ideas for a YouTube Kids Song Channel for your product https://AwesomeYtIdeas.com. Share it on 5 channels. Metric: organic_traffic.”**

It’s broken down, step-by-step:
1. Find a keyword people actually search for.
2. Write something helpful. Skip the fluff.
3. Hit publish.
4. Blast it out to X, Reddit, Indie Hackers, and two weird little communities you found last night.
5. Check your organic traffic in two weeks. (No peeking before then.)

Suddenly, you’re not wallowing. You’re stacking tiny wins. Feels different, right?

## Why Bother?

Sitting around, wringing your hands about “no users”? That’s not gonna summon them. (Trust me, I tried.)
But one action card a day? That’s 30 little wins in a month. Not bad.

By then, you’ll have:
- A blog that’s actually growing.
- Distribution habits you don’t have to think about.
- Traffic trickling in from all sorts of places.
- Momentum. (The good kind.)

## Last Bit

Quit saying *“no one’s here.”* Try, *“today I’ll ship something useful.”*

That’s the indie way: small, daily moves that add up. Sometimes they snowball. Sometimes they just make you feel less alone.

And if you want a system that makes it all easier—tasks, metrics, a roadmap—peek at [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com). That’s what the action cards are for. For days just like this.
