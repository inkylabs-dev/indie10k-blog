This morning, I was doing Indie10k's daily task - Reddit engagement. I stumbled across a random Reddit post (of course I can’t find it again 😅). The gist was simple:

👉 *“*I started thinking on a tool. The whole point is simple: type your idea, click validate, and it tells you in minutes what would normally take days or weeks of research — the pros, the risks, how much effort it would take, even what similar products already exist. this is only for solo founders who are building micro-SaaS apps.*”*

That hit me hard — because I’ve been in that exact trap. And it felt like a **perfect fit for Indie10k**.
## From Reddit Spark to Indie10k Fit

So I thought: while waiting someone getting enough courage to build a tool, why not build it by myself? A small validator tool that helps solo founders check if their micro-SaaS idea is worth even starting. Not some VC-style startup validator, but a quick gut-check for bootstrappers.

At first, I did some research on tools in the market. Oh my, so complicated. Lots of scores! charts! and a content farm of ideas (who know which is AI generated and nobody cares).

Finally I decided to forget about what others has built. I asked ChatGPT to break the requirement down using **first principles**.

The result was crystal clear:
👉 *“As a solo founder, I want a fast way to check if my micro-SaaS idea is worth pursuing, so I don’t waste weeks on something doomed from day one.”*

That was it. Core requirement nailed.
## Building the MVP (Lunch Break Mode)

I hacked together an MVP in ~30 minutes with the help of Claude Code. Just a textbox input → structured validation output. Nothing fancy. Quietly shipped it to production. No announcement. No promo. One single textarea plus a button, yield a one-liner, pros/cons, competitors and how competitive it is, what the MVP looks like and an export button.

Then I closed the laptop, went to the mall with my son, had coffee and waffles with my wife, and didn’t think too much about it.
## Nightfall Paranoia

Later the evening, the “what if” hit me:

- 
*What if this goes viral? ( i know, i know, unlikely at this stage)*

- 
*Will it burn through my LLM bill overnight?*

So I added a simple guardrail: login required. And one more thing — a button to **auto-convert the generated idea into a **[**project**](https://indie10k.com/faq)** inside **[**Indie10k**](https://indie10k.com).

That way it’s not just a toy validator, but a **sidecar tool** that naturally flows into the Indie10k core system.
## Why I’m Not Sorry for Idea Copying

Yes, this was inspired by someone else’s Reddit post. But honestly — ideas are free. Execution is what matters. And I want to execute faster. If it becomes a **cool linkable asset for Indie10k**, even better.

I would share same mindset to whoever will use this tool - Even your idea is a bit competitive, your execution changes everything.

🚀 And that’s how, in 8 hours, a casual Reddit scroll turned into a live Indie10k feature.
