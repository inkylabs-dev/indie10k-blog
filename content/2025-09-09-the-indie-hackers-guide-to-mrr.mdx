If you’ve been building projects for a while, you’ve probably seen the acronym **MRR** thrown around.

MRR stands for **Monthly Recurring Revenue** — and it’s the heartbeat of any subscription-based business. For indie hackers, though, it’s more than just a finance metric. MRR is the difference between:

-   _side project vs. real business_
    
-   _hobby income vs. ramen profitability_
    
-   _dreaming vs. quitting your job_
    

But here’s the catch: most resources on MRR are written for venture-backed startups, not indie devs. They bury you in acronyms (CAC, LTV, ARR, NRR 🤯) when all you really want to know is:

👉 How many users do I need, and how long will it take to hit $1k MRR?

----------

## What is MRR, really?

At its simplest:

**MRR = number of paying customers × price per customer per month**

-   10 customers paying $10/month → $100 MRR
    
-   50 customers paying $20/month → $1,000 MRR
    

That’s it. Nothing fancy.

Where it gets messy is when you try to project MRR into the future. Do you account for churn? Upgrades? Downgrades? Annual billing? Failed payments?

You _can_ include all of that. But early on, that’s like bringing a whiteboard full of equations to your morning coffee.

----------

## The Indie Problem with MRR Calculators

Most “MRR calculators” you’ll find online were designed for investors and finance teams.

They assume you’re tracking a dozen variables. They ask for inputs you probably don’t even have yet. They give you a spreadsheet instead of clarity.

And they don’t answer the one indie-first question:  
**When will I hit ramen profitability?**

----------

## A Simpler Approach

When you boil it down, early-stage SaaS (or subscription-based indie projects) only need three levers:

1.  **Plan Price ($/month)**
    
2.  **New Users per Month**
    
3.  **Churn Rate (%)**
    

That’s it.

### The algorithm:

-   **New MRR = New Users × Plan Price**
    
-   **Churned MRR = Current MRR × Churn Rate**
    
-   **MRR_next = Current MRR + New MRR − Churned MRR**
    

Run that over time and you’ll see:

-   When you’ll hit $100, $1k, $10k MRR
    
-   How many customers it takes to get there
    

No jargon. No spreadsheets. Just straight answers.

----------

## Why This Matters for Indie Devs

Indie hackers think in milestones:

-   $100 → proof that strangers will pay you
    
-   $1k → ramen profitable
    
-   $10k → quit-your-job or fund-your-team money
    

These milestones are motivational fuel. Knowing the timeline at your current pace can change how you work _this week_.

Instead of “I hope this grows,” you can say:  
“If I keep adding 10 users a month at $19 each, I’ll hit $1k in 7 months.”

That clarity is priceless.
