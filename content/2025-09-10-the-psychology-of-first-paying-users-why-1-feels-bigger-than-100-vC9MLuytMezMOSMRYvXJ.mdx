Everyone says it: *“Your first paying user is the hardest.”*

But you don’t really get it until someone actually swipes their card.

That first $1 is weirdly heavy. It’s not just money—it’s proof you’re not hallucinating this startup. It’s the jump from hobby to business, from theory to grind.

Why so hard?

- 
You’re pitching half-baked software.

- 
Nobody knows you.

- 
Your confidence is shaky.

That’s why the leap from $0 → $1 feels way bigger than $100 → $200. The first dollar is belief.

Once it happens, your brain rewires. You stop polishing endlessly and start asking: *“Okay, where do I find the next ten?”*

Don’t chase perfect. Chase $1. DM someone, launch a janky Gumroad, pre-sell. Because after the first dollar, momentum takes over.
