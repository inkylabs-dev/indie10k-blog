I had a vision. Users would open [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com), see **3 daily todos**, smash through them like Mario stomping Goombas, and boom — compounding growth.

Except… that didn’t happen.

What actually happened?
Crickets.
Half-finished cards.
People ghosting me after day one.

Turns out, asking indie hackers to juggle three todos a day is like asking a toddler to eat three different vegetables at dinner. Sure, technically possible — but you’ll be cleaning peas off the floor.
## Two Terrible Ideas

So I started spinning “solutions” in my head:

**1. Weekly-long guided track.**
Like a personal coach whispering, *“This week, young padawan, we shall do outreach.”*
But the more I mapped it, the more it morphed into a glorified habit tracker. I don’t want Indie10k to be a coach counting your push-ups.

**2. Playbooks from other founders.**
Copy-paste the paths that worked for them. Except — indie projects aren’t Ikea furniture. You can’t just follow the manual. Everyone hacks, tweaks, rips out pages, and rebuilds the shelf into a desk anyway. Also… building a library of playbooks would take forever.

Both paths smelled wrong.

And I had to admit it: I wasn’t smart enough to untangle this.
## Enter the Gold Prompt

In desperation, I threw the simplest prompt I could at ChatGPT:

“Use first principle, think down to the bottom and provide a simple, lean solution.”

And boom. Lightning.
## [The TenK 6 Is Born](https://indie10k.com/tenk6)

What came back was so clear, so *right*, I had that rare adrenaline rush. Like: ***This. This is the thing****.*

Here’s the recipe ChatGPT laid out (which I’ve since named **TenK 6**):
### What Are We Optimizing?

- 
**Meaningful experiments per week** (that actually touch signups, replies, or dollars).

- 
**Low cognitive load** (so you act today, not plan forever).

- 
**Tight feedback loops** (so tomorrow adapts to what you did today).

### Constraints

- 
Indie projects = messy. Avoid rigid playbooks.

- 
Early stage = don’t pile on authoring overhead.

- 
Users vary = need a universal system, not a catalog.

### Simple, Lean Solution:

**“Weekly North Star → One Daily Next Step.”**
#### A. Weekly North Star (WN)

You pick one track (Validate / Distribute / Retain / Monetize).
Then set a single outcome sentence:
*“By Sunday, I’ll have X evidence that Y hypothesis is true/false.”*
#### B. Daily Next Best Step (NBS)

One card a day. No more. No less.
Drawn from six universal step types:

- 
**List 5** (options, channels, assumptions)

- 
**Pick 1** (commit)

- 
**Ship 1** (publish, outreach, change live)

- 
**Ask 3** (DMs, emails, calls)

- 
**Measure 1** (screenshot a metric)

- 
**Share 1** (public update)

Each card includes a fallback (“shrink it to 10 min”) and a swap option.
#### C. Micro-Arcs

Not 30-day courses. Just 3–5 step bundles auto-generated from the six primitives.

Example:

- 
**Validate arc:** List 5 riskiest assumptions → Ask 3 strangers → Summarize evidence.

- 
**Distribute arc:** List 5 channels → Pick 1 → Ship 1 post → Measure 1 metric.

Feels like a playbook. But it’s built on Lego blocks, not hand-written curricula.
## Why It Works

Because it’s **light, flexible, universal**.
Because you can’t skip to day 14 — you unlock step by step, like a quest.
Because it forces you to ship evidence, not polish todo lists.

It’s Lean Startup + Agile + Build in Public… smashed into six repeatable atomic moves.

And nobody else has published this exact synthesis. It’s ours.
## Shipping It Fast

I immediately named it **TenK 6** (fits Indie10k’s brand, rolls off the tongue).

Then, in true boring builder fashion, I wrote a PRD, tossed it to Claude Code, and while I was writing this post, the prototype basically came alive. Weekly screen → daily card → retro update. That’s all it takes to start.
## Dogfooding

The second it worked, I used it on myself.

And… it just felt *right*.
Like sliding into the correct lane on a highway. Smooth. No friction.

Instead of staring at a list of todos (half of which I secretly didn’t want to do), I had one card. Clear, doable, connected to my weekly North Star. By the end of the day I had a small artifact — a metric, a DM, a post, whatever.

It wasn’t productivity theater. It was progress.
## Reflections

Looking back, the lesson isn’t just product design — it’s philosophy for indie devs:

- 
**Observe behaviors, not ideals.** If people aren’t finishing, that’s feedback. Don’t force it.

- 
**Lean over complex.** Complexity feels smart but kills momentum. Six primitives beat sixty tactics.

- 
**Evidence beats intention.** A quote, a metric screenshot, a shipped link — those artifacts matter more than “I thought about it.”

- 
**Constraints drive clarity.** One North Star, one step a day. You’d think it’s too little. It’s not. It’s freedom.

- 
**Don’t copy the whole playbook.** Most paths aren’t transferable. But the primitives are. Share building blocks, not scripts.

- 
**Build what you’ll use.** Dogfooding isn’t a checkbox; it’s the compass. If it doesn’t feel right in your hands, it won’t in theirs either.

Indie10k isn’t about tracking todos. It’s about nudging you into *one small, meaningful experiment a day* — so momentum snowballs without crushing your brain.

That’s the spirit of [TenK 6](https://indie10k.com/tenk6).
