Every week someone asks me:

“Is Indie10k the thing that will change the game for indie hackers?”

And my answer is always the same: Nope.

Let me explain.

**The Myth of the “Game Changer”**

Tools get hyped. Always have.

In the 90s, people swore the right CMS would launch your business.

In the 2000s, it was WordPress plugins.

Then it was “no-code,” then “AI,” then… insert buzzword of the week.

Now, Indie10k pops up on the scene. Clean design, quirky name, a dashboard that says “do this today.”

Neat. Helpful.

But a game changer? Nah.

The game hasn’t changed in decades.

It’s still: Build → Ship → Get Rejected → Try Again.

**Why Indie Devs Are the Real Game Changers**

Think about it.

A tool can’t force you to cold-DM that stranger on X.

A tool can’t stop you from doomscrolling instead of pushing your landing page live.

A tool can’t make your stomach stop twisting when you ask someone to pay for the first time.

But you can.

You—shipping a tiny MVP on a random Tuesday.

You—staring at Plausible at 1 a.m., celebrating one new signup like it’s Christmas.

You—writing a blog post (like this one) instead of polishing your CSS again.

That’s the game changer.

**What Indie10k Actually Does**

At best?

Indie10k is a nudge.

It’s a sticky note on your laptop that says “don’t overthink, just ship.”

It’s a little scoreboard that makes progress visible.

It’s a gym buddy who reminds you to show up, even when you’re tired.

But it’s not the reason you’ll hit $10k MRR.

You are.

**The Story I Keep Coming Back To**

A friend once told me:

“The hardest dollar you’ll ever make is the first one. After that, you’re addicted.”

He didn’t say, “The hardest dollar you’ll make is the first one… once you buy the perfect productivity app.”

Nope. He said it’s about guts.

That first customer doesn’t care what tool you’re using—they care that you cared enough to build for them.

**So Here’s the Punchline**

Indie10k is not a game changer.

Indie devs are.

We’re the weirdos who keep building, keep shipping, keep laughing at our own bug reports.

We change the game every time we dare to ask,

“Would you pay for this?”

And if Indie10k ([https://indie10k.com](https://indie10k.com)) helps you get there a little faster?

Cool. That’s all it needs to be.
