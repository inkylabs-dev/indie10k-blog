I’ve been coding for day job for 15 years.
And I’ve killed… 65 side-projects. 🪦

Every single time: build → polish → nobody use → move on to next project.

This time I forced myself into the **TenK6 loop**:

🔹 **List 5**
I wrote down 5 ideas:

- 
a sudoku game

- 
a YouTube content idea generator

- 
a video editor that ditches Capcut/Canva

- 
a growth coach

- 
(and one more I forgot already)

🔹 **Pick 1**
I picked “growth coach” → called it **Indie10k**.
People told me *don’t put a number in the domain*. But they don’t understand—first **$10k MRR** means everything for indie devs.

🔹 **Ship 1**
No over-building. After 65 corpses, I finally didn’t touch “clean architecture.”
Just Next.js boilerplate → deploy to Vercel since commit 1.
Landing page + fake login → **shipped Day 1**.

🔹 **Ask 3**
Didn’t wait for “perfect.” I posted on IndieHackers, Product Hunt forum, and even sent Reddit DMs. People actually signed up after reading the pitch. People said Indie10k is gold and like it.

🔹 **Measure 1**
I’ve run three loops:

- 
V1 = too big, too heavy

- 
V2 = still too heavy

- 
V3 = finally lean enough → I can see users buying in, moving their first TenK 6 loops and towards the goal they set.

🔹 **Share 1**
For god’s sake, why didn’t I do this earlier? Nobody told me.
I used to only see code. Now I talk about pain → solutions.
And only offer Indie10k if a user is engaged.

That tiny shift—**habits, not features**—is why Indie10k hasn’t died like the others.

Curious: how many projects did *you* bury before one finally stuck?
