If you’ve been in software for a decade or two, you’ve probably built everything from enterprise APIs to internal dashboards.  
You know how to write code, ship features, and debug 3 AM production fires.  

But going indie? That’s a different game.  
It’s less about typing speed and more about rewiring a few habits that don’t come naturally to long-term devs.  

Here are seven shifts I had to wrestle with (and still remind myself of daily).  

---

## 1. From Shipping Features → Shipping Experiments  

In corporate dev life, success = shipping stable features with tests, reviews, and CI/CD pipelines.  
In indie life, success = testing if someone *cares enough to use or pay for it.*  

You need to ship experiments, not just features. Ugly MVPs, quick landing pages, half-baked prototypes.  
The goal isn’t polish — it’s validation.  

---

## 2. From Building Alone → Talking to Strangers  

Most devs prefer solving problems in code, not in conversations. But indie hackers need customer discovery.  

Talking to strangers feels awkward at first, but it’s where the “aha” moments come from.  
Start with five. The first five users will tell you more than a hundred lines of logging.  

---

## 3. From “Perfect Architecture” → “Just Works”  

Decades in dev culture trains you to think long term: scalability, maintainability, clean abstractions.  
Going indie, you need to cut that down.  

If a duct-taped script works and validates demand, that’s a win. You can refactor later (if the market exists).  

---

## 4. From Deadlines → Feedback Loops  

At a job, you ship on sprint deadlines. As an indie, there are no managers breathing down your neck.  
The replacement? Feedback loops.  

Post your updates publicly, email your users weekly, measure signups. Feedback is your new boss.  

---

## 5. From Learning Tech → Learning Distribution  

Dev brains are wired to pick up new frameworks, databases, or tools.  
But as an indie hacker, your new framework is marketing.  

Learn SEO, copywriting, communities, distribution.  
Shipping without distribution is like coding without deploying — it doesn’t matter.  

---

## 6. From Comfort Zone → Public Zone  

Many long-term devs lurk online. To go indie, you’ve got to *show your work.*  

Share progress, failures, screenshots, numbers. Building in public is scary, but it compounds:  
strangers find you, cheer for you, and sometimes become customers.  

---

## 7. From Employee Mindset → Ownership Mindset  

The biggest shift isn’t technical. It’s psychological.  

At work, you execute someone else’s vision.  
As an indie, you’re the CEO, PM, marketer, and dev.  

You own the wins, the losses, and the ambiguity. That’s heavy — but also liberating.  

---

## Final Note  

If you’ve been coding for 10+ years, you already have the hardest skill: the ability to build.  
The difference between staying “just a dev” and becoming a true indie hacker isn’t adding *more code*.  
It’s rewiring a few habits so your code meets the real world.  

Start small. Change one habit this week.  
Share one build in public.  
Talk to one stranger.  
Ship one scrappy experiment.  

Momentum is the real unlock.

💬 For the long-term devs here: which of these habits feels hardest for you to shift? Or, if you’ve already gone indie — which one made the biggest difference?
