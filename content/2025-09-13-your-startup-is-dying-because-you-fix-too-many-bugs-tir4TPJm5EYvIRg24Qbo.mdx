Your startup isn’t dying from bugs. It’s dying because you keep fixing the wrong ones. I built a simple rule to decide which bugs to ignore (yes, even the one still live at [indie10k.com](http://indie10k.com) 👀). Do you fix everything… or let some ride?

This bug I didn’t fix looked awful.

A user added some data, clicked Save, and… nothing happened. Blank screen. Crickets.

They thought it was broken. But under the hood, the data was saved — I just forgot to refresh the list.

I panicked: “This is it. They’ll rage-quit.”

But nope. The user hit refresh, saw their data, and moved on. I didn't get even complain.

That’s when it clicked: most bugs don’t kill your startup.

But dropping everything to fix them will kill your momentum.
### **🔥 My Bug Rules (a.k.a. The “Do I Care?” Test)**

1. **Adoption blockers**. Can people sign up? Yes → ship. No → fix it yesterday.

- 
Example: Stripe checkout failing? 🔥 Fire drill.

- 
Example: Signup button misaligned on mobile? Meh.

2. **Engagement killers**. Does it stop the core loop? → fix soon.

- 
Example: “Save” button doesn’t actually save? Yeah, fix that.

- 
Example: Loading spinner spins too long but still works? Welcome to indie dev life.

3. **Outcome stealers**. Can users still get a win? If yes, defer. If no, fix.

- 
Example: Can’t share progress screenshot = fix.

- 
Example: Annoying tooltip overlap = defer.

4. **Trust nukes**: Payments broken, data loss, privacy leaks → never defer.

- 
Example: Double charge on credit card? Fix before lunch.

- 
Example: Dark mode button does nothing? Refresh and move on.

### 💡 The ugly truth:

Every indie hacker I know has wasted days polishing a “critical” bug that users didn’t even notice. Meanwhile, the real growth work sat untouched.

Momentum &gt; perfection.

Ship &gt; pixel perfect.

Trust, adoption, outcomes → those are the only bugs that deserve my 2 a.m. panic.
### 👉 Try it yourself

Head over to [indie10k.com](http://indie10k.com) and see if you can spot the feature that still behaves exactly like my first “Save → nothing happens” bug.

(I know about it. I still haven’t fixed it. On purpose.)

Comment if you find it. 😉
