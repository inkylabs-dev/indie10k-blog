Today felt like three different startup lives packed into one.

First, I set a date: **Oct 1 is when the beta ends**. After that, Indie10k kicks into subscription mode. Hey, I mean, why not ? 01/10 is a perfect symbol of first MRR $10k.

It feels surreal—up until now everything’s been wide open, but I want to keep it generous for early adopters.

So here’s the deal: if you leave at least one piece of feedback (via the dashboard feedback button on the bottom right or just email [[email&nbsp;protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9ffcf0f1ebfefcebdff6f1fbf6faaeaff4b1fcf0f2) ) *and* complete one real TenK 6 loop with evidence (no blind step-checking!), you’ll get a **50% lifetime coupon**. I’m capping it at 50 coupons. Momentum deserves to be rewarded.

Meanwhile, Claude Code (my invisible co-founder) quietly shipped the subscription system. I haven’t tested it yet—because honestly, it’s not urgent for another half-month—but [polishing the pricing and billing pages](http://indie10k.com/pricing) helped me explain what I want: even in free mode you’ll still get TenK 6 core features, one loop a month. Just enough momentum to keep indie dreams alive.

Then came dogfooding.

I finished my first **TenK 6 Arc** in the production system, and published the build log here: [https://indie10k.com/s/TIhdY8Ba](https://indie10k.com/s/TIhdY8Ba). In just three days, eight users have gone through the new onboarding flow, and some already hit the second loop step. Seeing people actually move through the system is more energizing than any analytics chart.

Of course, no day without bugs. After starting a new Arc, users would sometimes see the last step of the old one hanging around like a ghost. Not fatal, but confusing—so I fixed it.

And while I was in there, I added something I’ve wanted for a while: **archiving Arcs**. Because in indie life, stopping early is not failure. It’s momentum saved. Clicking “complete” just to get a fresh Arc is fake progress. Archiving is honest progress.

I also wrote a new blog post: *“Copycats Aren’t Your Biggest Threat”* ([https://indie10k.com/blog/2025-09-15-copycats-arent-your-biggest-threat](https://indie10k.com/blog/2025-09-15-copycats-arent-your-biggest-threat)). The gist: distribution beats differentiation. Copycats can steal your idea, but they can’t steal your distribution.

And now, the next challenge begins: I just started a new Arc called **Crew Plan**—bringing team support into Indie10k.

I’m still in the pain-point-listing stage. If you’ve ever tried collaborating as an indie dev, tell me what hurt. Reader / writer / admin roles? Just want to see partner's progress? Something else? Pin me your thoughts—I’ll be listening.

It’s a lot for one day. Beta countdown, coupons, subscription system, my own Arc, a bug fix, a new feature, a new blog, and now a fresh Arc. But that’s the beauty of TenK 6: evidence, loops, and momentum.
