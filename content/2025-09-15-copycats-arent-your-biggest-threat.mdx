## The Scary Clone Scenario

You’ve launched, shared your project on Hacker News, maybe even picked up your [first paying user](/blog/2025-09-11-first-paying-users-psychology). Then, out of nowhere, someone posts a nearly identical product. Same features, shinier landing page.  

Gut punch, right? Feels like game over.  

But here’s the thing: it almost never is.  

## Originality Is Overrated

Most successful businesses aren’t original snowflakes. They’re riffs. Slightly better UX. A new pricing model. Serving a different audience.  

Look at how many email tools exist. Or website builders. Or project trackers. If “being first” was the only advantage, half the SaaS industry wouldn’t exist.  

What actually matters? The boring stuff: showing up, building trust, compounding traffic, keeping momentum with [daily quick wins](/blog/2025-09-08-no-user-vs-daily-quick-wins).  

## Distribution Beats Differentiation

Copycats can steal your idea. They can’t steal your distribution.  

If you’ve built up a small but loyal following—through [organic growth loops](/blog/2025-09-14-build-traffic-without-ads), a newsletter, community presence, or even word-of-mouth—they’ll stick with you. People buy from people they know, not just whoever shows up next.  

And differentiation? It doesn’t have to be giant. Sometimes it’s just *you*. Your voice, your support, your story. Indie hackers underestimate how much personality is a moat.  

## The Real Threat: Silence

Honestly, the scarier scenario isn’t getting copied—it’s nobody caring enough to copy you. If your idea has “clone potential,” congratulations. That means there’s actual demand.  

The danger isn’t competition. It’s irrelevance.  

## Keep Moving

If you find yourself worrying about clones, here’s a reframe: they validate the market for you. While they’re busy catching up, you’re already iterating. Shipping the next version. Writing the next blog. Landing the next user.  

That motion is your advantage. That’s how you stay ahead.

Copycats aren’t the enemy. Stagnation is. Keep shipping, keep compounding, and keep your eyes on the real prize: momentum.
