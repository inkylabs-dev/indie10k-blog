I build things lean, one week at a time.

The [Indie10k PRD Generator](https://indie10k.com/tools/prd-generator) is a codification of my internal ritual: **thinking from first principles, cutting scope, and shipping with clarity**.

It’s not “another PRD tool” — it’s how I do it, and I think other indie devs will benefit from seeing &amp; using the system.
### What is this thing

- 
Describe your idea in 5-10 lines.

- 
The tool runs a first-principles thinking pass (hidden by default).

- 
It then generates a one-page, shippable spec you *actually* build in a week.

- 
Format is opinionated: **Problem → User &amp; Job → Success Metric (7 days) → Solution → Scope v1 → Risks → Next steps.**

- 
No fluff. No sprawling docs. Just momentum.

### Why I built it this way

- 
**First principles thinking by default**
Most PRD tools flood you with optional sections you might never use. I believe that the best ideas survive when you strip away everything non-essential. So unless something is essential, it doesn’t make it into v1.

- 
**Focus on weekly ship**
If it won’t fit or be built in one week, I either delay or drop it. The structure forces you to scope V1 lean.

- 
**Single metric, actionable next steps**
Success metric with a time window (7 days), risks identified, and explicit next steps. Because without those, “PRD” is just a doc, not a compass.

- 
**Shareable, repeatable, simple format**
Copy / export to Markdown. Same structure every time. Keeps me aligned, especially when delegating work or handing off to Claude Code. No surprises.

### How I use this internally before coding

Whenever I have an idea:

- 
I open a doc or this generator.

- 
I write down the basic idea (5-10 lines), along with current constraints: time, resources, existing dependencies.

- 
I use the generator or my internal equivalent to run “first-principles analysis” + define the one metric I’ll measure in 7 days.

- 
I sketch out “Solution” and “Scope v1” tightly so it's buildable.

- 
I write out Risks &amp; Next Steps.

- 
Then I pass the PRD to Claude Code or start coding myself.

Because of this ritual, I rarely overbuild, don’t get lost while building, and have a built-in kill/iterate call whenever metrics or feedback are ugly.
### What makes it different from other PRD tools

- 
It doesn’t give you options for *everything*. It gives you what I believe matters most.

- 
It doesn’t idolize completeness — the goal is clarity + speed.

- 
It’s made *for solo/small builders*, not PMs with committees. Indie constraints baked in.

### Would you use something like this?

I’m curious:

- 
As an indie dev, do you find this structure helpful — or constraining?

- 
Do you prefer totally freeform PRDs, or ones that are opinionated like this?

- 
If you tried this generator, what would make *you* come back and use it for every idea?
