The ebook covers:

- Why indie projects stall

- The six TenK 6 loops (with examples + micro-exercises)

- Four growth tracks: Validate, Distribute, Monetize, Retain

- How to reflect, scale with small teams, and avoid burnout

Itâ€™s short. Itâ€™s practical. Itâ€™s written like an Indie Hackers build log, not a startup bible.

I'm still refining chapters. But, hey, why not give it a early teaser?

If youâ€™ve ever struggled with finishing or keeping momentum, I hope this helps.

Would love feedback â€” even just one insight youâ€™d add or disagree with.
