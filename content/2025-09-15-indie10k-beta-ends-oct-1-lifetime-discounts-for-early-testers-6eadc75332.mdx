We’re wrapping up our beta testing phase on Oct 1, 2025. Until then, all early adopters still have full access to every feature, no limits. 🚀

🎁 We’re also giving away 50 lifetime subscription coupons (50% off) — but with a catch:

•	You need to provide at least 1 real piece of feedback (via the Feedback button or email 📩 [[email&nbsp;protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bdded2d3c9dcdec9fddad0dcd4d193ded2d0)).

•	And complete at least 1 full TenK6 loop with real evidence (no blind checkbox ticking — trust me, evidence-based loops are the magic ✨).

After Oct 1, we’ll switch over to subscriptions. But for now, it’s still wide open — perfect time to try things out, break stuff, and tell us what sucks. 😅

Thanks again for helping shape this from the ground up. Couldn’t do it without this crew. ❤️
