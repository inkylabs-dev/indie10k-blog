## Why

Because apparently writing long rants in Indie Hackers comments doesn’t count as “publishing.”

Also because I kept explaining my TenK6 loop to friends and they nodded politely but clearly wanted a cheat sheet.

So—fine.

Ebook time.

Free, because (a) I’m nice, and (b) I have no clue if anyone will pay for my half-baked wisdom yet.
## What

It’s called The TenK6 Handbook [https://indie10k.com/tenk6-handbook/index.html](https://indie10k.com/tenk6-handbook/index.html) . Think of it as the IKEA manual for indie devs: tiny loops, step-by-step arrows, none of the little cartoon people holding Allen keys.

It’s not “War and Peace.” It’s more like “War and Ship.” Quick to skim, light to carry, maybe even bathroom-reading-friendly.
## Where

Built entirely in markdown. Why markdown? Because I’m lazy. And also because tools like mdBook exist and I can yell “mdbook build” like I’m shipping rockets.

Hosted on GitHub Pages (because free) and later on jammed into a Next.js app.

Also dumped on Indie10k as a shiny lead magnet. Please clap.
## Behind the Scenes (a.k.a. Confessions of a Professional Side Project Graveyard Digger)

Here’s the truth: I’ve buried WAY MORE side projects than I’ve launched. My résumé should honestly say *“Dr. Professional Side Project Graveyard Digger.”*
The ebook started as yet another “half-built Notion doc” destined for the graveyard about SEO, growth and unix philosophy. But then two things happened:

- 
I kicked off Indie10k project (very seriously, I mean, if it won't make $10k, I won't go to the next) and came up with a new methodology: TenK 6.

- 
I told myself, “Either ship this thing, or it’s going into the hole with the others.”

Suddenly the ebook became less about *writing* and more about *exorcising ghosts.*

The most surreal moment: realizing the whole TenK6 loop—List, Pick, Ship, Ask, Measure, Share—was actually helping me escape the graveyard. I was literally using the system to build the book about the system. Recursive chaos.

I particularly love the ending of the book:

Reaching $10k MRR isn’t magic.
It’s not luck.
It’s the compounding effect of dozens of small loops, stacked patiently and relentlessly.

The sooner you start, the sooner momentum takes over.

So don’t just close this book.
Close your laptop, grab a sticky note, and write:

**List 5.**

Your first loop starts now.
