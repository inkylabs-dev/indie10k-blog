Every indie dev I know has wrestled with this:
“How do I describe my product so people *get it*?”

You sit down to write, and suddenly:

- 
You list out features nobody cares about.

- 
You try sounding clever and end up sounding generic.

- 
Or you just stare at a blank page, stuck.

Sure, you can fire up ChatGPT. I’ve done that a hundred times. Sometimes it spits out gold, but other times it’s rambling, fluffy, or just… off. It’s not consistent.

And that’s the real pain: **as indie makers, we don’t have hours to massage prompts and edit outputs. We need a repeatable way to get crisp, benefit-driven descriptions every single time.**
### The benefit I wanted

Something that gives you clarity in seconds, not hours. A way to position your product around:

- 
The *pain* your customer feels

- 
The *benefit* they get

- 
A short, persuasive line you can drop on your landing page or Product Hunt launch

### What I built

So I made a tiny AI tool: [**SaaS Product Description Generator**](https://indie10k.com/tools/saas-product-description-generator)**.**

You type in three things:

- 
Product name

- 
Who it’s for

- 
The problem it solves

Hit “Generate,” and you get 5 sharp product descriptions instantly. No fluff, no guessing.
### How I built it

I kept it brutally simple: one page, one button, one result. I wanted this to be a *repeatable playbook*—not an AI toy that sometimes works and sometimes doesn’t.
### How I’m shaping it

Right now it’s barebones, but intentionally so. My plan:

- 
**Phase 1:** Help makers consistently ship clear descriptions.

- 
**Phase 2:** Add small tweaks like tone variations (quirky, professional, persuasive).

- 
**Phase 3:** If people love it, layer in saving/exporting for launches and directories.

I’m not building a “platform.” Just a sharp little tool that solves one painful moment in every indie journey.
### My ask

When you’ve used ChatGPT for product descriptions, what’s the part that frustrates you most—prompt tweaking, inconsistent tone, or endless editing?

That’s what I’m trying to solve. Would love your thoughts 👇
