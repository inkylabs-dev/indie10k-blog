You don’t need a 10‑page spec to ship. You need clarity.

Today we’re launching the PRD Generator — a lean, constraint‑driven tool that converts a short idea description into a one‑page PRD you can actually build this week.

Link: [/tools/prd-generator](/tools/prd-generator)

## Why another PRD tool?

Generic AI prompts tend to produce bloated docs. This one is different: simple, indie‑dev facing, and biased toward shipping in one week.

- Built by indie devs, for indie devs — no enterprise fluff
- First‑principles by default — cut scope before you add
- One‑screen mentality — if it can’t fit, it can’t ship
- Constraint‑driven output — consistent sections you can act on
- One‑click copy/export — straight into build mode

## How it works

1) Describe your idea in 5–10 lines.  
2) Analyze (first principles): produces a concise reasoning pass that cuts non‑essential features and locks scope to a one‑week MVP.  
3) Generate PRD: streams a tight Markdown PRD with Problem, User & Job, Success Metric (7 days), Solution, Scope v1, Risks, and Next steps.

Made for momentum. Shippable in a week.

## When to use it

- You’re circling an idea but keep over‑scoping
- You want a PRD you can execute in 5–7 days
- You need a shareable spec to align a collaborator
