Today I made a **micro-decision** (aka: the kind of decision that looks small but somehow eats three cups of coffee and half a morning).

Do I:

- 
🚧 **Hard-gate evidence** → block users until they upload proof.

- 
🧾 **Invent “Evidence Debt”** → let them skip but slap a scary red badge on the step.

- 
🪶 **Keep it light** → just a friendly popup: “No evidence yet?” → [Add Evidence] / [Skip Anyway].

After arguing with myself like two raccoons in a dumpster, I picked 🪶 **Keep it light.**

Why? Because I don’t want Indie10k to turn into a debt collector. 

The whole point is momentum, not making people feel guilty about screenshots.

So… no new “concepts,” no extra red pills, just a nudge and move on. 

I can still spy on the data in the backend, but users don’t have to think about it.

This is not that kinda "growth" feature but I feel it has a great impact on the core process of this product. So I make it as Top 2 feature to deliver.

Wait, what was Top 1 then? In case you missed it: [https://indie10k.com/tenk6-handbook/index.html](https://indie10k.com/tenk6-handbook/index.html)
