New feature just went live in Indie10k: **a project’s build-in-public story page.**

It’s literally a gallery of your public shares. That’s it. Super dead-simple.

Here’s me dogfooding it with Indie10k itself:

👉 [https://indie10k.com/p/0228187a-ebab-4dd1-8292-90bcb3857455](https://indie10k.com/p/0228187a-ebab-4dd1-8292-90bcb3857455)

A couple notes from the trenches:

- 
I’m very *restrained* about turning this into a full “community.” Indie10k is still early, and I don’t want to pile on features just because other platforms have them.

- 
Rejected the **AI-suggested comment section** (too bloated, spam risk, moderation headache).

- 
Kept a **Like button** though — it’s the right balance: feedback without drama.

So now, if you’re using Indie10k, you don’t even have to worry about “writing a build log.” Your public shares already *are* your story. 🎉

It's not designed to ditch Indie Hackers! You can craft your story in Indie10k, and share it to the town center (Indie Hackers).

It’s a profile, it’s a gallery, it’s that simple.
