Hey IH,

I’m testing a new feature in Indie10k: a dead-simple public profile where your project’s build-in-public story lives as a gallery of shares. No fuss, no “community bloat,” just a place to show progress.

Before I overbuild, I want to hear from you.

[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-Wnowbgi-GuJYkLVq64Qj3X7d6Gbkoctw86We5de2jXYmNA/viewform?usp=dialog](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-Wnowbgi-GuJYkLVq64Qj3X7d6Gbkoctw86We5de2jXYmNA/viewform?usp=dialog)

What I’m asking:

- What actually motivates you to share your project publicly?

- What features/rewards would make you more likely to do it?

- What barriers stop you right now?

I’ll use responses to figure out which user segment cares the most, and invite some folks for short follow-up chats. This way, I don’t end up building “yet another ghost town.”

Goal = evidence of a user creating a public share + list. That’s our North Star. 🌟

If you’ve ever hesitated to “build in public,” I’d love your input.
