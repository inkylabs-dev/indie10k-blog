Iâ€™ve noticed most of us struggle with momentum. We start side projects, hit a wall, then the project ends up in the graveyard.

I wanted a place where the goal is simple and shared: hit $10k MRR. Not unicorns, not VC pitches â€” just steady indie growth.

So I created [r/indie10k](https://www.reddit.com/r/indie10k/)  ðŸš€

Itâ€™s built around the TenK6 methodology (List â†’ Pick â†’ Ship â†’ Ask â†’ Measure â†’ Share). The idea is to keep looping, sharing evidence, and holding each other accountable until we hit the milestone.

ðŸ‘‰ My ask: would you use Reddit as a place for indie build logs &amp; progress? Or do you think IH itself already serves that role?
