Hah, this is gold. 👏

Let’s assume I’ve been hiding behind “another week of research” for like… forever. [This $100 experiment idea](https://indie10k.com/blog/2025-09-18-the-100-experiment) is like ripping off the bandaid: fast, kind of scary, but also exciting.

Big wins:

- 
one question, one metric, one stop rule. Keeps things focused.

- 
$100 isn’t trivial, but it’s not going to haunt you if things flop. If you're not sure  it works, cut it down to like $20, whichever you feel comfortable.

And honestly, that’s the beauty of it → it’s **permission to fail cheaply**. Instead of endless “what ifs,” you just toss money in the fire and *see what actually smokes*.

Let’s assume half the time you get garbage results. Fine. You only wasted a pizza night. But the other half? You get a real signal that might’ve taken months of hand-wringing to discover.

Feels less like “marketing spend” and more like buying a lottery ticket for clarity. 🎟️

But yup, better to have messy early signals than perfectly polished guesses.
