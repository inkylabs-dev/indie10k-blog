Be honest: when was the last time your “baby” side project saw real traction? 👶🚀

Not your mom’s compliment. Not just one single customer (who happens to be your dad). Not the one random upvote. Actual pull.

I just dropped a post on When to Quit Your Side Project: ([https://indie10k.com/blog/2025-09-17-when-to-quit-your-side-project](https://indie10k.com/blog/2025-09-17-when-to-quit-your-side-project)) .

It’s about spotting green lights (tiny wins that mean keep pushing) vs. red lights (soul-sucking flatlines).

The trick? 6-week kill criteria.

Commit → run 2 experiments → mid-check → pull the plug (or double down).

Because at maximum SIX loops of TenK 6 ([https://indie10k.com/tenk6](https://indie10k.com/tenk6)) should should be enough to tell you if an idea is worth investing.

Because dragging a zombie project for months is way scarier than burying it early. 🧟‍♂️
