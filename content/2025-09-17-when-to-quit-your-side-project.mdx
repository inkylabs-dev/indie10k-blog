## The honest gut-check

Every side project hits the swamp. It starts shiny, then turns into chores and question marks. Should you push a little longer? Or cut the line and swim to shore?

Here’s a simple, slightly opinionated way to read the signals—so you’re not quitting too early or clinging for too long.

## A quick contract with yourself

Before anything else, write this down (yes, actually write it): what “progress” means for the next 6 weeks.

- One metric you own (not vanity): signups, weekly active users, MRR, retention, demos booked.
- A minimum line in the sand: e.g., +25 WAUs, +5 paid, 20% 4-week retention, 5 qualified conversations.
- Two experiments you’ll ship no matter what.

Now you have something to measure against, not just vibes and caffeine.

## Green lights: keep pushing if…

- Pull is increasing. DMs, forwards, replies. People show up uninvited. Even a trickle counts if it’s compounding week over week.
- Retention isn’t amazing yet, but it’s improving. Day 7 retention inching up? Fewer users ghosting after first use? That’s momentum talking.
- Someone paid you. Or tried to. Money is a loud signal. Ten bucks from a stranger is worth a hundred compliments from friends.
- Sales loops are shortening. Conversations move from “what is this?” to “how do we try it?” in fewer messages.
- You keep getting the same request. Annoying? Sure. But repeated pain is roadmap gold.

Micro rule: if two of those are trending up for three straight weeks, you’re not done here.

## Yellow lights: consider a pivot if…

- People “love the idea” but don’t use it. Or they try once, then disappear like it’s a gym membership.
- You’re solving three different problems for three different audiences. That’s… three projects.
- Growth only happens when you scream. Ads stop? Growth stops. Might be a channel problem. Might be a product one.
- Support tickets beg for a different product than the one you want to build. (Ouch.)

Micro rule: if activation is okay but retention is meh, pivot the promise—not the core—first. Reframe the positioning, tighten the ICP, ship one strong “aha” path. Then re-measure.

## Red lights: it might be time to quit (for now)

- Flat for 8–12 weeks on your primary metric despite shipping real experiments. Not tiny tweaks—real tries.
- You avoid working on it even after rest. Be honest: you don’t like the customers, the problem, or the loop.
- Churn > new. Every step forward is erased next week.
- You’re making “grand rewrite” plans to avoid talking to users. (Been there. Didn’t help.)
- The best-case path still doesn’t excite you. Future you is rolling their eyes.

Micro rule: set “kill criteria” up front. If X doesn’t happen by Y, you pause or stop. Saves you from sunk-cost theater.

## The sanity math

- Time runway: how many focused hours can you invest weekly for the next 6 weeks? Be specific.
- Money runway: what’s the cost to hit your next learning milestone? Not “to success”—to the next clear answer.
- Optionality: if you stop now, does that unlock something higher-odds? A better distribution channel, a clearer niche, a partner?

If the math says you’re starving both the project and yourself, pick one to feed. Ideally you.

## Experiments that actually move the needle

When in doubt, ship experiments that reduce uncertainty, not just add features.

- Price test: put the price on the page. Let folks self-qualify.
- Narrow ICP: pick one use case, one segment. Say no to the rest for two weeks.
- Onboarding: remove one step. Add one in-product nudge at the moment of need.
- Distribution: one guest post, one podcast cameo, one partner email. Quality > scattershot.

And if content is your bet, it’s a long game. No sugarcoating. If you care about search, learn how to [rank competitive keywords](/blog/2025-09-10-how-to-rank-competitive-keywords). Unsexy, but it compounds while you sleep.

## Pivot vs. persevere (quick map)

- Keep going: more people are arriving, a few are paying, retention inches up, and conversations feel warmer. Feels like work—but the flywheel is trying to spin.
- Pivot: activation yes, retention no; interest yes, money no. Change the promise, audience, or channel—one at a time.
- Quit: no movement after real attempts; you dread it; future potential doesn’t light you up. Archive with notes. Future you might revive it with a clearer angle.

## How to quit without burning the value

- Write a short post-mortem for yourself. What worked. What didn’t. What you’d try first if you came back.
- Open-source a piece. Or ship a tiny template/productized asset from the parts.
- Email users to say thanks and point them to alternatives. Classy. Also: people remember.
- Park the domain, keep the repo. You’re not deleting the idea—just taking its batteries out.

## Permission to pause

There’s a weird shame around stopping. Don’t buy it. Projects are reps. Reps build taste. Taste finds winners.

You’re not a quitter if you walk away from a dead end. You’re a builder saving your energy for a path that pays you back.

## A tiny ritual (6 weeks)

- Week 0: define progress, set kill criteria, pick two experiments.
- Week 3: midpoint review. If nothing moved, pivot the promise. Hard.
- Week 6: decide. Double down, pivot again, or pause. Decide with your calendar and wallet, not your ego.

You can do a lot in 6 focused weeks. You can also waste six months without decisions. Ask me how I know.

## Final note

If you’re on the fence, pick a path that increases surface area for luck: talk to more users, narrow your promise, ship faster, and measure less stuff—but measure it weekly.

And hey—if you want daily, practical, indie-friendly tactics that actually ship (and occasionally kick you in the shins when you need it), come hang out at [Indie10k](/).
