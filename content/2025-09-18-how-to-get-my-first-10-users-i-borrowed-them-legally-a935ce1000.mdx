👋 Ever host a party and forget to send the invites? That’s what launching a product with no audience feels like. Disco ball ready, snacks out… silence.

Instead of grinding away on the “content hamster wheel of doom,” I’ve been playing with something called BOPA (Borrow Other People’s Audiences).

Some of you may already be familiar with this. For whoever not sure what it is, it's not as shady as it sounds. Basically: show up in existing communities, be useful, and—when the timing’s right—mention your thing.

Yeah, it's that simple.

Quick playbook:

1.	Find your people. Subreddits, Discords, even weird FB groups about pickles.

2.	Be human first. Empathy, congrats, tips, value. BUT NO LINKS.

3.	Gentle exchange. Only after trust is built, share your tool/story.

I tested this and got early users way faster than trying to blog into the void.

Not magic, just smart. Borrow trust. Borrow reach. Make friends.
