So Indie10k is crawling out of the “beta testing cave” and I’ve been busy cooking up magnet lead assets to lure in fellow indie hackers.

First came **TenK 6 Methodology**. Then the **TenK 6 Handbook**.

And now… the trilogy gets its third sibling:
### **Read it here:&nbsp;**[**Momentum Hacks**](https://indie10k.com/momentum-hacks/index.html)

**Stop waiting for motivation. Start rolling with momentum.**

Motivation is like a sugar rush—it spikes, it crashes. Momentum? That’s the slow, steady drumbeat that keeps you moving even on meh days.

This little book is a playbook for indie hackers and creators who want to ship consistently without the burnout badge of honor. In **15–60 mins/day** you’ll learn how to:

- 
Slice work so small it *always* ships

- 
Log proof that keeps you rolling

- 
Ask smarter questions → get faster feedback

- 
Run lightweight weekly rituals

- 
Rescue momentum when you’re running on fumes

I’m publishing it free with **mdBook**, but I gave the default theme a little “indie hacker polish”:

- 
Sidebar now flexes Indie10k’s title + logo so it’s clear it’s part of the toolkit.

- 
Every chapter ends with a CTA—because momentum without signup is just… vibes.

Whether you’re a solo builder or a tiny crew, *Momentum Hacks* is here to help you work with your energy as it is, not as you wish it were.

**Momentum beats motivation. Every time.**

It's definitely in early stage - lots of sections are incomplete with a few brief bulleted items of what I plan to say. But hey, it's a good starting point, right? Ship, collect feedback, and feel the momentum!

Curious, do you prefer to have a paper print copy of this book?
