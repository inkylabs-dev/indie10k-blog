Today’s theme: how I argue with ChatGPT about features until one of us gives up. Spoiler: it’s never me.

I’m shipping the next version of indie10k’s main dashboard. Beta folks are moving closer to $10k MRR (🔥), but I noticed two pain points:

- 
Some people stall and stop shipping.

- 
Others keep clicking next without proof they actually did the thing.

That breaks the TenK 6 loop. No ship = no momentum. No evidence = no way to fine-tune later.
### Step 1: Throw spaghetti

I tossed ChatGPT a list of ideas: daily hacks, weekly retros, better Arc loops, journaling small wins. Then told it: *“use first principles and tell me what’s actually worth building.”*

It spit back a decent analysis. But decent isn’t good enough. So I kept poking:

- 
“Nah, too bloated.”

- 
“That’s someone else’s product.”

- 
“Explain it like I’m five.”

- 
“Cut harder.”

### Step 2: Trim the fat

One by one, we killed ideas:

- 
Public feed? Backlog.

- 
Experiment ledger? Nope, duplicate.

- 
Header counters? Cute, but bloat.

What survived? **A dead-simple private feed.** Just a place on the dashboard where you log today’s progress, drop a link/metric/note, and maybe use it as a mini retro. While all feed item are TenK 6 loop data. No break of core flow. That’s it. No fluff.
### Step 3: Momentum check

So far in TenK 6:

- 
**List 5** ✅

- 
**Pick 1** ✅

- 
**Ship 1** 🚧 in progress

Momentum feels good. ChatGPT plays the overeager intern; I play the grumpy boss with scissors. The combo works.

Next step: ship the private feed, then move to **Ask 3**.
### Lessons Learned

- 
**ChatGPT is great at brainstorming, but terrible at saying no.** If I don’t play the grumpy boss, I end up with 10 shiny features I’ll never ship.

- 
**First principles cut deeper than feature lists.** Every time I asked “does this actually help someone hit $10k MRR faster?” another feature died. And that’s good.

- 
**Plain English saves the day.** Fancy words = easy to fool yourself. When I forced it to explain things simply, the real winners (and losers) showed up.

- 
**Momentum &gt; perfection.** The point wasn’t to design the “perfect dashboard.” It was to keep shipping lean slices that push indie devs forward.

At the end, what stuck was a *tiny private feed*. Not sexy. Not overengineered. But exactly what helps the loop stay alive.
