## The truth no one wants to hear

SEO is like planting a stubborn tree. Weeks of nothing. Then a twig. Then one day… shade. Not magic, just compounding doing its boring, beautiful thing.

If you need results by Friday, SEO won’t save you. But if you’re trying to make your future self’s life easier? This is the game.

## Short-term oxygen vs. long-term gravity

You need both. Oxygen today, gravity tomorrow.

Short-term oxygen:
- Social posts that punch above their weight
- Launches: Product Hunt, Reddit, a friendly newsletter cameo
- Partnerships: one co-marketing email can beat a month of tweets
- Sales work: DMs, demos, actual conversations (wild!)

Long-term gravity:
- Search pages mapped to real intent (problem pages, tool pages, comparisons)
- Update cycles that keep winners fresh
- Internal links that pass juice where it matters
- A content cadence you can do tired on a Tuesday

## What “slow” really means (calibrate your clock)

- New domains: 3–6 months for movement, 6–12 for steady rankings
- Competitive terms: 6–18 months unless you’ve got authority already
- Evergreen posts: small lifts monthly, big lifts quarterly

Not a law. Just the vibe of the internet. Expectation-setting keeps you sane.

## What to publish (and why)

- Problem pages: “How to X without Y” — captures early intent
- Comparison pages: “X vs Y” — catches shoppers mid-decision
- Alternatives pages: “Best alternatives to X” — high-intent, low patience
- Integrations/connectors: tiny pages, sneaky strong
- Case notes: one-page writeups with screenshots, not PR fluff

Some will flop. That’s fine. You only need a few compounding pieces to carry the rest.

## Mid-game: juice your flywheel

- Refresh top performers every 60–90 days (new examples, FAQs, screenshots)
- Add 2–3 internal links from older posts whenever you publish something new
- Ship a lightweight tool or calculator to earn natural links over time
- Use descriptive anchors, not “click here” (your future self thanks you)

And if you’re chasing the scary terms, understand how to actually [rank competitive keywords](/blog/2025-09-10-how-to-rank-competitive-keywords). It’s not hacks. It’s patience, updates, and a few solid backlinks.

## How to survive the first 90 days

- Set weekly inputs (2 pages, 5 internal links, 1 refresh). Ignore the scoreboard for a while.
- Track leading indicators: impressions, position trend, SERP coverage. Not just clicks.
- Keep shipping distribution: 1 partner, 1 post, 1 email. Don’t starve the project while SEO warms up.

## When to double down vs. pivot

- Doubling down: impressions up, average position rising, a few keywords breaking onto page one
- Pivoting: no movement after 90 days on multiple pages in the same cluster — try a new cluster or narrower intent
- Killing: a page that never gets impressions after 6 months — fold it into a stronger sibling
