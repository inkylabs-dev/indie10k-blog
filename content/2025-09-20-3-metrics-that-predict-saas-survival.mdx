## The problem with dashboards

Most metrics look great right before a cliff. Pretty charts, ugly futures. The fix: track a few numbers that predict survival, not just describe the past.

## Metric #1: Activation Rate (did they reach the first outcome?)

Define your “aha.” Not a click. Not a login. The first real outcome.

- For analytics: created a dashboard + shared a link
- For docs tools: wrote a doc + added a collaborator
- For automation: turned on a live workflow that ran at least once

Compute it: activated users / signups in a fixed time window (e.g., 7 days).

Green zone: > 30–40% for most self-serve tools. If you’re below 20%, fix onboarding before buying more traffic.

## Metric #2: 4-Week Retention (do they come back without bribery?)

Measure the percent who are active 4 weeks after signup (same action family as activation). Cohort it by signup week.

Why 4 weeks? It catches the “looked cool, forgot about it” crowd. If you can hold users to week 4, your product probably lives in their workflow.

Green zone: 20%+ is promising for many indie SaaS. Lower? You’ve got a leaky bucket.

## Metric #3: Net Revenue Retention Lite (NRR-L)

Full NRR needs lots of data. Early on, use a lightweight version:

NRR-L = (MRR from cohort after 3 months) / (MRR from that cohort in month 1)

- >100% means expansion offsets churn. Magic.
- 80–100% means you’re holding ground. Okay.
- &lt;80%? You’re sprinting to stay in place.

## Sanity checks (don’t game yourself)

- Same definitions every week. No sneaky re-labeling.
- No discounts counted as revenue. (Sorry, not sorry.)
- Leads ≠ signups. Signups ≠ activated.

## What to do with the numbers

- Low activation: improve the first-run path; in-product prompts; tighter promise on the landing page
- Okay activation, low retention: fix the habit loop; add value moments; prune edge features
- Decent retention, weak NRR-L: pricing/packaging, usage-based nudges, team features

And if you’re hunting for demand with content, remember: it’s a slow burn. Learning to [rank competitive keywords](/blog/2025-09-10-how-to-rank-competitive-keywords) will pay you back for years while you tune the product.

## Final note

Three numbers. Weekly cadence. Honest eyes. Do that for 8–12 weeks and you’ll know if this thing is a business or a story. If you want templates and gentle accountability, come hang out at [Indie10k](/).
