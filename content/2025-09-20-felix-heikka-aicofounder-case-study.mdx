Felix Heikka and David Heikka has shipped both flops _and_ winners. The flops? Painful. Months of grinding, crickets on launch day, and the sinking feeling of _“uh oh, no one actually wants this.”_

The winners? Way more fun. And the secret wasn’t magical copywriting, or ads, or even being some kind of growth genius. Nope. The difference was simple: **validating the problem before building**.

Here’s how They looped their way to $10k/month with [AICofounder](https://aicofounder.com), using three tight **TenK 6 loops**.


## 🎯 Loop 1: “Do people even care about this problem?”

They started with a hunch: founders don’t have a structured way to validate ideas. They just kind of wing it, waste time, and pray. (Been there.)

Instead of jumping into code, he ran the first TenK 6 loop:

- **List 5** possible founder pains → wasted time, validation chaos, no user input, bloated MVPs, no feedback.
- **Pick 1** → “no structured way to validate ideas” felt the strongest.
- **Ship 1** → They made a survey + posted it to [r/SaaS](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/) and [r/indiehackers](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/). But here’s the trick: They offered feedback in return. That bribe made it easy to get responses.
- **Ask 3** → 8–10 founders filled it out.
- **Measure 1** → most said “yes, this hurts” and “yes, I’d use a solution.”
- **Share 1** → They shared the learnings and gave themself the green light. 🚦



## 🛠 Loop 2: “Okay, let’s actually build something”

Now came the fun part—building. But not feature-creep building. Loop-style building.

- **List 5** → five possible features users mentioned.
- **Pick 1** → the bare minimum. No fluff.
- **Ship 1** → MVP in 30 days. (Because who wants to drag it out?)
- **Ask 3** → They showed it back to the survey folks.
- **Measure 1** → people said “yeah, I’d try this.”
- **Share 1** → They announced the MVP and started onboarding testers.



## 📈 Loop 3: “Time to get people in the door”

With something live, They needed real users. Cue marketing loop.

- **List 5** → possible channels: Reddit, X, IH, LinkedIn, newsletters.
- **Pick 1** → focused on Reddit + X (where founders already hang out).
- **Ship 1** → daily grind: 5 posts + 50 replies on X, then recycling the best stuff onto Reddit.
- **Ask 3** → They DM’d users for blunt feedback.
- **Measure 1** → target was 20 active users in 2 weeks. Result? 100 users. 💥
- **Share 1** → They documented progress publicly, which pulled in even more users.



## 🚀 The Aftermath

Those three loops alone got AICofounder from “just an idea” → MVP → **$10k+/month in revenue**. After that, growth became easier. Why? Because the loops never stopped—users shaped the product every cycle.

The takeaway: if you’re stuck wondering whether to build, stop guessing. Run a loop.

👉 That’s exactly what the TenK 6 is for—List, Pick, Ship, Ask, Measure, Share. Their story is proof it works.
