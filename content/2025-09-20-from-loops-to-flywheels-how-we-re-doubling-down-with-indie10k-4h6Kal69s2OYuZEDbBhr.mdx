Hey IH,

I wanted to share some behind-the-scenes thinking on how we’re shaping Indie10k — our little tool that helps indie devs get to $10k MRR with the TenK6 loop.

We noticed something: indie devs keep posting questions about how to get my first customer, will you pay me if i build it, etc.

- 
Some never get past “Ship”

- 
Others move forward without really making one buck.

So we took a step back and asked ourselves:

👉 Instead of trying to solve everything, where should we double down?

That’s when a simple method clicked for us:

Predict → Breakthrough → All-in

- 
Predict the market pain (devs can’t turn free users into paying ones)

- 
Find one breakthrough point (the first paid conversion)

- 
All-in on that

Next Indie10k will refocuse around one story:

help indie hackers get their first paid user, then spin the flywheel.

The flywheel looks like this:

Evidence → Conversion → Success Cases → Growth → back to Evidence.

Our job is to be the engine in the middle:

- 
Make it dead simple to capture evidence (emails, posts, in-app prompts)

- 
Show where conversion happens

- 
Turn those into success stories that attract more builders

Everything else gets cut. No bloated project management features, no “big growth hacking dashboards.” Just tools that shorten the path from 0 → first paying customer → $10k MRR.

We’re sharing this openly because we know a lot of you wrestle with the same thing: do we go broad or go deep?

Right now, we’re choosing deep. Double down on the single bottleneck that matters most.

Would love to hear:

- 
What was your breakthrough moment to your first paid user?

- 
If you’re still on the way — what’s the #1 friction you feel right now?

Thanks for reading — and if you’re curious, we’ll keep posting updates as we ship a better [indie10k](https://indie10k.com) for the entire indie hackers community.
