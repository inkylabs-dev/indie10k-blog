So… my landing page was doing its thing. Text, screenshots, yadda yadda. But I had this hunch: ppl doesn't connect with Indie10k enough.

Cue experiment.
## List 5 user pains

Here are common questions you can found in subreddits:

- 
“I launched and nobody signed up. I don’t know what to do next.”

- 
“I waste time trying random tactics — Reddit, Twitter, ads — nothing sticks.”

- 
“I keep building features, but users don’t care. I feel invisible.”

- 
“I lose momentum. I start projects, stall out, and my repo turns into another graveyard.”

- 
“I don’t have a clear, repeatable system — growth feels like guessing and luck.”

### Pick 1

“I launch. Nobody signs up. I have no clue what to do next.” (aka every indie dev’s nightmare 😬)
## **What I shipped**

A 25-second YouTube Short. Literally me to camera:

- 
“You launch. No signups. Brutal, right?”

- 
“You post everywhere, nothing works.”

- 
“That’s why I built Indie10k — a growth coach with simple daily steps.”

- 
“Now you’re stacking wins + actually hitting traction.”

Then I yeeted it onto the landing page right by the CTA.
## **Here are my asks**

- 
Beta users: “Does this finally click for you?”

- 
Founder friends: “Did the hook punch you in the face or just boop your nose?”

- 
Random viewers: “What’s fuzzy?”

## **Measure**

I'll measure these metrics in the following days:

- 
Signup lift (please please please).

- 
Watch-through rates (3s / 10s / 25s).

- 
CTA clicks when video is visible.

### **Share**

This post. 🙃 If it works, I’ll chop it into a 15s meme-cut, test dumber hooks like “Nobody cares about your launch…” and maybe add a graveyard gag.

Moral of the story: sometimes you don’t need a shiny new feature…** just a face saying the thing**. It's not that scary after all.
