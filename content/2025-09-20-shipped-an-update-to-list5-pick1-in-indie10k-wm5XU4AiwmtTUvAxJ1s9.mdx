Hey IH,

I just pushed a small but important change inside **Indie10k** (my tool to help indie founders hit $10k MRR using the TenK6 loop).

The update is for the **List5 → Pick1 step**.

Turns out, going from “brainstorm 5” to “commit to 1” is way harder than it looks. People were stalling there, so I reworked the flow:

- 
cleaner UI, less clutter when choosing

- 
the picked 1 will be displayed through the TenK 6 loop cycle.

- 
more flexibility (AI can help, but you stay in control)

- 
smoother step-through so you don’t lose momentum

Would love feedback from fellow founders:

👉 Do you personally prefer structure when narrowing ideas, or do you just “go with gut”?
