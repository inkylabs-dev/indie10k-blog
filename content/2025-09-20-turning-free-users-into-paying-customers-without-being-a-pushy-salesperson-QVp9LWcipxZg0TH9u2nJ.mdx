Free users are like that friend who keeps “borrowing” your Netflix login… lovable, but never paying rent. 😅

I put together a post on how to gently turn free plan wanderers into actual paying customers (without naggy pop-ups or sleazy tactics). Think:

- 
Soft walls that kick in right after they taste success.

- 
CTAs that sell outcomes (“Add teammates”) not vague “Go Pro”.

- 
Upgrade flows that feel like a natural step, not a whole new product.

TL;DR: it’s about timing + clarity, not pressure. If you get that right, free users upgrade themselves.
