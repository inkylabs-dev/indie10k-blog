One of the most common questions I get from founders using Indie10k is:  
_“Okay, I’ve got my List5… but how do I actually pick the right one to focus on?”_

That step — going from brainstorming 5 possibilities to committing to 1 — is simple on paper but surprisingly tricky in practice. It’s the moment where momentum can stall.

So, I just shipped an update to **make the List5 → Pick1 flow smoother**.

### What’s new

- A clearer, guided flow that helps you compare your 5 quickly.
- More flexibility: you can still let AI assist, but you’re in full control.
- Simpler UI: less noise, more focus when making that decision.

### Why it matters

Momentum in the TenK6 loop depends on actually _moving forward_. If picking your “1” feels clunky, you hesitate — and that hesitation costs you time, energy, and focus.

This update is meant to remove friction, so you can commit faster and keep the loop rolling.

### Try it & tell me

The best part? This change came directly from early user feedback (thanks to everyone who pointed out where the old flow felt clunky 🙌).

I’d love for you to try it out and let me know:

- Does it feel smoother?
- What still feels awkward?

Your feedback shapes Indie10k more than anything else.

Let’s keep building momentum together. 🚀
