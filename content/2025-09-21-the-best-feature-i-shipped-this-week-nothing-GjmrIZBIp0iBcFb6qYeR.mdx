We all talk about shipping fast. Launch early, iterate weekly, keep momentum alive.
But here’s the catch: not every week should look like a feature buffet.

This past sprint I felt the itch: “Shouldn’t I add something new? Maybe a shiny dashboard, a feed, a leaderboard, or another automation?”
Instead, after coming several feature proposals for [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com), I resisted. I fixed bugs, tightened UI flow, cleaned up small annoyances.

**Reliability itself is a feature.**

- 
A stable product builds trust.

- 
A consistent product builds habit.

- 
A boring product (in a good way) builds revenue.

15 years of work experience in big tech has made me think of progress as OKRs, KPIs, quarterly plannings, monthly feature check-ins, etc.

I thought progress = new features.

But, **in indie world, progress = any action you have taken, including rejecting new feature additions**. It can be as little as *removing friction* , or maybe just having a chat with a user about their actual pain.

What do you think—does *not shipping* sometimes help you ship faster in the long run?
