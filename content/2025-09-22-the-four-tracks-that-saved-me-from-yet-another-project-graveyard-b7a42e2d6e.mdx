I used to think growth = “just post/tweet more.”

Nope. Turns out growth = four tracks you can’t skip:

- Validation (do people even care?)

- Monetization (will they pay?)

- Distribution (can I reach more?)

- Retention (will they stay?)

In [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com) , you can actually set your North Star Goal on one of these tracks and run it through a structured loop. Tiny steps, compounding momentum, no more wandering in founder limbo.
