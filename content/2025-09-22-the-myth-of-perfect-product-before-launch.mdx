## Perfection is a stall tactic (ask me how I know)

“Just one more feature.” “One more refactor.” “New logo?” You know the drift. Weeks vanish, confidence doesn’t budge, and the user count stays… theoretical.

Here’s the uncomfortable truth: polish hides uncertainty; shipping reduces it. Shipping also makes you a little sick to your stomach. That’s normal. That’s the point.

## Define ‘good enough’ in writing (before you get precious)

Pick a target outcome users can achieve in under 10 minutes. Write a mini contract:

- One job to be done the product can genuinely complete
- One narrow audience who really feels that job
- One feedback surface (email, in-app, Discord) you promise to watch daily
- Two follow-up experiments you’ll run within 7 days of launch

If the above is true, it’s launchable. Not pretty, not proud—launchable.

## Scope like you’re allergic to bloat

- Cut any feature that doesn’t help the user reach the first outcome
- Hardcode the weird stuff
- Manual process behind the scenes? Fine for v0. (Robots can wait.)
- Defaults over settings. Pick for them. You can add toggles later

Ship a thin slice that actually gets someone to “aha,” not a wide slice that looks impressive and does nothing.

## The first 7 days after launch (what to actually do)

- Talk to five users who tried—and failed—to get value. Fix one blocker a day
- Add one in-product nudge exactly where folks stall
- Publish a changelog note every other day. Momentum is marketing
- Compare your promise to reality. If they don’t match, change the promise first

## Distribution isn’t a side quest

No one finds a quiet, perfect product. Get loud in small, useful ways:

- Two niche communities that actually care (be helpful, not spammy)
- One partner with overlapping users (guest post, co-demo, a joint tweet)
- A tiny content wedge that can eventually [rank competitive keywords](/blog/2025-09-10-how-to-rank-competitive-keywords)

Let the early edges compound while you iterate.

## What perfection really costs

- Time you could’ve spent learning from the market
- Motivation (shiny turns to sludge, fast)
- Optionality—because you locked into a guess instead of testing a slice

Truth: your taste improves with reps, not drafts. Launch creates reps.

## Final note

Launch earlier than feels comfortable, then iterate like a craftsperson. You’ll move faster, learn faster, and—surprise—build something people actually use.
