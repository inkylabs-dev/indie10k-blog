So here’s the thing.
Knowledge is free — Reddit, X, YouTube are stuffed with it.
But discipline? Momentum? That’s the rare Pokémon.

I built **Indie10k** because I kept making the same mistake:
Ship feature → feel good → do zero outreach → hear crickets 🦗

[Indie10k](https://indie10k.com) is basically a gym for indie devs.
Instead of lifting weights, you lift growth loops.
[TenK 6 Methodology](https://indie10k.com/tenk6) = a simple  cycle that compounds into traction + $$$.

Here’s what’s next on my mind (not a giant roadmap, just vibes):

- 
**Polish the core workflow** → make them feel snappy, especially for impatient devs (me 🙋‍♂️).

- 
**Stripe is live** → now thinking free users get a few loops, then paywall. Taste first, gate later.

- 
**Milestone** → 100 signups, then I *need* 1–2 people to actually finish a loop and share results.

- 
**Content flywheel** → blog posts → turn into IH/Reddit/X threads → keep sharing playbooks.

- 
**Linkable freebies** → Notion template + starter playbooks that double as SEO bait.

- 
**Early revenue push** → maybe a lifetime “early supporter” deal, just to prove $$ flows.

- 
**Fun experiments** → contests like “Oct: first subscriber challenge” so growth feels like a game.

Longer-term, I want a place where indie hackers track their reps, share evidence, and actually build momentum (instead of staring at crickets 🦗).

Anyway, curious if you’d actually *pay* for something that keeps you accountable — not just teaches theory.
