## Why it works (even when you’re small)

Attention is expensive. Trust is priceless. Building in public buys trust with receipts: what you shipped, what broke, what you learned.

People don’t follow perfect. They follow progress.

## The ingredients (you already have them)

- A weekly demo: a gif, a 30-second video, or 3 screenshots
- A number you care about: WAUs, demos, revenue, or even “messages sent”
- A short note on “what surprised me” each week

This is the anti-highlight reel. It reads human because it is.

## What to share (without giving away the farm)

- Roadmap slices, not secrets: what you’re solving next and why
- Customer stories with permission (blur the names, keep the lesson)
- Mini post-mortems when you ship a fix in 24 hours
- Distribution experiments, including the flops (they help more than you think)

## Where to share (pick 2, be consistent)

- X/Twitter + a niche community (Discord, subreddit, forum)
- Personal blog + lightweight newsletter
- Occasional cross-post to LinkedIn (yes, really)

## The compounding bits

- Serendipity: partners and customers find you “by accident”
- Credibility: you’re the person doing the thing, not just talking about it
- SEO: your build notes turn into long-tail posts that can [rank competitive keywords](/blog/2025-09-10-how-to-rank-competitive-keywords) later

## Avoid the cringe

- Talk about the work, not yourself. “Shipped X, learned Y, next Z.”
- Share numbers with context, not flexes
- Don’t teach too early. Show, then reflect

## A 30-minute weekly rhythm

- 10 min: pick 1 artifact (gif/screenshot)
- 10 min: write 5 bullets (shipped, blocked, learned, next, ask)
- 10 min: post in 2 places, reply to comments later

That’s it. Keep the bar low, keep the loop going.
