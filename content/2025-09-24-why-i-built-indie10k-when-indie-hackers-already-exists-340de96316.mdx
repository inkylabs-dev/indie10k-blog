The first DM I got after launching Indie10k was: “Wait… isn’t this just Indie Hackers?”

Fair question. IH is the town square — endless wisdom, success stories, and support. But here’s what I kept running into: I’d read all the stories, bookmark all the lessons… and then do nothing systematic next.

Indie10k isn’t trying to replace IH. It’s the workshop to IH’s square. Instead of more stories, it gives you a structured path: one North Star goal, weekly nudges, evidence-based next steps. Not AI “magic,” just enough structure to turn advice into momentum.
