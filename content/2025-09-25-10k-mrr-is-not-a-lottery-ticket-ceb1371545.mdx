When I first started indie hacking, I treated $10k MRR like a jackpot.

One “big” launch, one viral tweet, one lucky break — and boom, financial freedom.

Reality? I launched dozens of projects. None got attention, most even had  0 sign-ups. Nothing stuck. The graveyard kept getting bigger.

What I was missing wasn’t luck. It was **discipline**.

## The Gym, Not the Lottery

Think about fitness.

Everyone knows push-ups are free on YouTube. But people still pay for gyms, personal trainers, and habit trackers. Why? Because **discipline is scarce, knowledge is free.**

Growth is the same. You have read enough indie hacker "successful stories". You don’t need another “secret strategy.” You need a system that keeps you coming back and compounding.

## Loops, Not Hacks

Inside [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com), I built the idea of loops:

- List → brainstorm small growth actions

- Pick → choose one

- Ship → put it into the world

- Ask → get feedback

- Measure → track what moved

- Share → close the loop by telling the story

Run that once, you get a data point.

Run that weekly, you get momentum.

Run that for months… you start to see MRR stack up.

## Why $10k MRR Feels Different Now

don’t see $10k as a lucky break anymore.

I see it as a fitness milestone. The result of hundreds of reps, not one shot.

Right now, I’m at 98 signups in Indie10k. No revenue milestone yet — but the loops are compounding, the discipline feels real, and I can see the path in front of me.

## The Takeaway

If you’re chasing $10k MRR, stop looking for the golden lottery ticket.

Start building your growth gym.

Track loops. Stack evidence. Stay consistent.

Because momentum is the only unfair advantage you can actually control.
