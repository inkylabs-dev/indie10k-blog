Lots of indie dev I know has *that* notebook page:
A big goal scribbled at the top, a few bullet points under it, and… nothing ever happens.

Indie10k is my attempt to fix that. The centerpiece? **The Arc**.
## What’s an Arc?

An **Arc** is a structured path from your North Star goal (like “hit $1k MRR”) down to a sequence of small, actionable loops.

Instead of a vague “do marketing,” you anchor your Arc with:

- 
A measurable **North Star metric** (ex: newsletter subs, trial signups, $MRR).

- 
Pre-built **loops** (the TenK6: List, Pick, Ship, Ask, Measure, Share).

- 
Evidence tracking along the way (so you actually *see* progress).

Each Arc isn’t just a plan — it’s momentum you can come back to every day.
## Why Not Just a To-Do List?

Because indie hacking is less about tasks, more about *discipline and momentum*.
You can finish 20 to-dos and still not move your needle.

An Arc keeps you tied to one guiding metric, so every loop you run compounds toward it.
## My Own Arc (Today at 98 🎉)

Right now, my Arc is:

- 
**Goal:** 100 active users inside Indie10k.

- 
**Metric:** User Signups.

- 
**Loops:** posting on IH, PH, medium, devto, and running small distribution tests.

[Today I’m sitting at **98 signups**](https://indie10k.com/s/TpjsYUaA). That means the next 2 people to join push me across the first big milestone. 🚀

It’s not life-changing MRR yet, but it *feels real*. Every loop shipped, every share, every tiny metric nudge is stacking up.
## Why I’m Sharing This

I want to know if this resonates:

- 
Does “Arc” feel like a useful container for indie goals?

- 
Would you actually track your growth this way?

I’m testing this *in public*, so your feedback will literally shape the product.

👉 Join [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com) if you want to try running your own Arc.
Think of it as a daily growth gym for indie devs — but instead of push-ups, you’re shipping loops.
