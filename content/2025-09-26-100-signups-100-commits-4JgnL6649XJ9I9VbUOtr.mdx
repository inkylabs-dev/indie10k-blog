Today Indie10k hit two milestones at once:

- 
**100 indie devs signed up**

- 
**100 git commits shipped**

It feels poetic: every commit = a rep. Every signup = a person stepping into the gym.
## Why I Call Indie10k a Growth Gym

Indie devs don’t lack knowledge. Growth tactics are everywhere—Reddit threads, blog posts, YouTube.
What we lack is discipline and consistency. That’s why gyms exist: you don’t need new push-up tutorials, you need the environment that makes you show up and put in the reps.

Indie10k is that for growth.

- 
**North Star Goal** = your fitness goal (bench 200lbs / hit $10k MRR).

- 
**TenK 6 loops** = your workout sets.

- 
**Daily nudges &amp; structure** = your personal trainer.

It’s not about reading more “how-to-grow” blogs. It’s about building momentum and sticking to reps until results come.
## Selling Point (soft pitch 😉)

If you’ve ever:

- 
Shipped features but heard crickets,

- 
Felt guilty you’re “bad at marketing,”

- 
Started but never finished your “growth experiments”…

Then you’re not broken—you just don’t have a gym for your growth habits.

That’s what I’m building. And the first 100 signups already tell me I’m not alone in needing this.
