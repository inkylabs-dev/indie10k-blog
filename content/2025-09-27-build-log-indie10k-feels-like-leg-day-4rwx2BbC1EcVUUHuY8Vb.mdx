Growth is more like the gym.
One rep at a time. Sets. Rest. Repeat.

In the gym: squat → rep → set → muscle grows.
In startups: loop → ship → measure → share → traction grows.

I don’t need one “big launch PR” miracle.
I need a hundred tiny reps.
Each loop is a rep. A handful of loops is a set.
Take a breath. Then go again.

This is what you typically do in [indie10k](https://indie10k.com):

- 
Pick project

- 
Write 5 tiny growth actions

- 
Ship one today

- 
Ask 3 humans for feedback

- 
Measure result

- 
Share publicly

It’s not hype. It’s training.
And training compounds.
