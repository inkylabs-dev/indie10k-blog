I’ve been grinding on a SaaS for months. Built loops, goals, steps, dashboards… and got 100 signups.

However, I still cannot get strong paywill from user.

I know TenK 6 framework works, because it's what bring me here.

But it has a little issues - high cognitive load for first time user.

Then I tried something simpler: one “rep” a day.

A rep is just one actionable move you can do today to push growth. No six-step system, no dashboards, no fluff.

I shared a handful of these reps as a newsletter test. Within 24 hours, people told me:

“I’d pay for this if the content stays sharp.”

That was more signal than a month of system-building ever gave me.

**Lesson:** people don’t want “productivity frameworks.” They want something to do today that makes a difference.

So now I’m building [**TenK Reps**](https://indie10k.com/reps) — a library of **no-fluff, one-step growth actions**. Each one is short, direct, and forces you to move.

I’m testing it as:

- 
A free daily newsletter of reps.

- 
A paid tier for accountability: streaks, evidence, badges, gamified reps.

Instead of asking users to climb a six-step ladder, I’m just handing them one rep at a time.

**Question for you all:**
If I ship 30 reps and drop one new rep every day, would that keep you hooked?
