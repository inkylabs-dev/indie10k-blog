I noticed something.

The [TenK 6 methodology](https://indie10k.com/tenk6) works well for disciplined indie devs.
But for impatient ones, it doesnâ€™t.
Theyâ€™ll try one step, maybe two, and then stop.

After watching this happen, I killed a dozen plans (and two experimental builds) and landed here: [**TenK Reps**](https://indie10k.com/reps?utm_source=indiehackers).

Bit-sized growth tricks with immediate payoff. 
Perfect for the impatient builder persona.
Unlike the other newsletters, I call each issue a `rep`.
Pretty much like you do ten push-ups at gym.
Actionable, quick action, and more importantly, no fluff.

Right now, itâ€™s just a lightweight newsletter â€” no tight integration into the TenK core app yet. But feedback has been strong: in interviews, users said theyâ€™d actually pay for this.

Hereâ€™s an example rep:
ðŸ‘‰ [Write Your Story Tweet](https://indie10k.com/reps/write-your-story-tweet-70ef291b-bfc7-4d6e-ba5a-e15944587920)

Follow strategies like this for a few weeks, and youâ€™ll grow your X audience â€” more traffic for your product.

**Question:** would you rather keep reading TenK Reps as a newsletter, or see it integrated into the indie10k core system (so you can attach evidence and track how reps connect to growth goals)?
