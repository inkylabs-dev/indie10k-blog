**Signups don’t pay bills. Clarity does.**

Most indie hackers hide behind walls of text. We write long pitches, fancy feature lists, and clever taglines. Then wonder why no one clicks.

If you can’t explain your product in one line, you don’t have a product people get. You have noise.

A clear one-line offer cuts through all that. It tells your user what you do and why they should care, instantly. No brain burn. No translation needed.

Think of it like this: if a stranger asked “what do you do?” and you couldn’t answer before the elevator doors closed, you failed.

One good line can be your headline, your tweet, your pitch. One bad line and you’ll keep rewriting landing pages forever.

### Rep

Write your one-line offer. Share it with one person today. If they get it, keep it. If they hesitate, cut it sharper.
