Most indie founders treat growth like a lottery ticket.
Ship the product, hope for launch day fireworks, and pray that one tweet goes viral.

But here's the truth: growth isn't luck. Growth is training.

## The Fitness Parallel

When you walk into a gym, you don't expect to bench 200 lbs on day one.
You start small: reps, sets, rest.

One rep is a single full execution of an exercise â€” one squat, one bicep curl.

Multiple reps strung together form a set. For example, 15 squats in a row.

Rest between sets gives your muscles time to recover and come back stronger.

If your workout plan says "3 sets of 15 reps", you:

Squat 15 times (Set 1).

Rest.

Squat 15 times (Set 2).

Rest.

Squat 15 times (Set 3).

You're done.

Simple. Structured. Repeatable. And over time, those reps build strength, endurance, and results.

## Now, Apply It to Growth

Your startup's growth works the same way.

**One Loop = One Rep**
A complete cycle of the TenK 6 framework:
List 5 â†’ Pick 1 â†’ Ship 1 â†’ Ask 3 â†’ Measure 1 â†’ Share 1.

**Multiple Loops = A Set**
Running several loops in a row compounds learning and traction.

**Rest / Reflection**
Just like your muscles, your brain and strategy need recovery. Pausing to measure and reflect is part of the system, not a waste of time.

## Why Reps and Sets Matter for Founders

In fitness, reps and sets aren't random â€” they shape your results:

Build strength â†’ Heavy weight, fewer reps.

Build endurance â†’ Lighter weight, more reps.

Build muscle â†’ Moderate weight, more volume.

In growth, it's the same:

**Find validation** â†’ Fewer, sharper loops aimed at testing demand.

**Build traction** â†’ More loops, focused on distribution and exposure.

**Scale revenue** â†’ Consistent loops stacked into larger arcs.

It's not about doing "all the things."
It's about doing the right reps in the right sets for the right goal.

## Why Indie10k Exists

[Indie10k isn't another blog, course, or "growth hacks" listicle](/blog/2025-09-25-indie10k-vs-indiehackers).
It's your growth gym.

TenK 6 Loops are your reps.

Sets of loops build compounding growth habits.

Evidence logs are your workout diary.

[North Star Goals](/blog/2025-08-08-mrr-goals-10k-milestone) are your training plan.

Community sharing is your accountability partner.

And just like in fitness: knowledge is free, but discipline is scarce.
That's why people pay for gyms even though workouts are on YouTube.

## Ready to Train?

Think about your past projects:

Did you ship features but get silence?

Collect signups but never see a payment?

[Lose momentum after launch day](/blog/2025-09-12-launch-fatigue)?

That's not because you're "bad at marketing."
It's because you never built a habit system for growth.

[Indie10k](/blog/2025-09-02-indie10k-launch) gives you exactly that:
discipline + structure + momentum.

## The Training Approach vs. The Lottery Approach

**Lottery Approach:**
- Build for months in isolation
- Launch once with maximum effort
- Hope for viral moment
- [Give up when it doesn't happen](/blog/2025-09-17-when-to-quit-your-side-project)

**Training Approach:**
- [Start with evidence, not building](/blog/2025-09-27-why-build-then-launch-keeps-failing)
- Run consistent growth loops
- [Measure what actually moves the needle](/blog/2025-09-20-3-metrics-that-predict-saas-survival)
- [Build in public](/blog/2025-09-24-building-in-public-the-indie-hackers-unfair-advantage) to compound learning
