Building is already busy. Growth makes it harder.

Every day I see the same posts here:

“How do I get my first 100 users?”

I’ve been there. Dozens of projects. Lots of launches. Most died before anyone cared.

That’s why I built [indie10k.com](http://indie10k.com) , a growth gym for indie devs.

Instead of guessing, it gives you bite-sized reps: one concrete growth action you can do today.

No theory. No fluff. Just one step that compounds.

I’m using it myself, and early users are already telling me it feels like the missing piece.

👉 Curious: what’s been your hardest part about finding first users?
