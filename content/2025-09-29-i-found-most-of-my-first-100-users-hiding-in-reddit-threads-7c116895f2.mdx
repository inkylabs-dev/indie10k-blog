We waste months building.

Then launch… silence.

But your first users aren’t “out there.” They’re already ranting on Reddit.

I stopped coding and started listening. Threads with keywords like “stuck”, “anyone else”, “how do you deal with…” turned into my idea lab. One thoughtful comment → 3 DMs → 10 beta users.

The trick: no links, no pitches. Just conversations. If people engage, you’ve struck demand. If not, you saved yourself months of wasted time.

Now I treat Reddit like [a growth gym rep](https://indie10k.com/reps/reddit-first-code-later-b16294b3-e26d-4edc-916d-cade5fb718cf?utm_source=indiehackers). 10 minutes a day. One thread. One insight. Momentum compounds.
