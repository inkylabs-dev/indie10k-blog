For the past few months, [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com?utm_source=indiehackers) has been running in open beta. Youâ€™ve seen me ship imperfect code, experiment in public, and chase down bugs with duct tape. That was the messy but necessary warm-up.

Today, that chapter closes. Open Beta ends. And in its place: **Day 1** of [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com?utm_source=indiehackers) as a product you can actually buy can actually use to grow your SaaS.
## Our Goal: Help Indie Devs Win

Indie10k is built on a simple mission: to help indie developers escape the graveyard of half-finished projects and actually grow something sustainable.

You already know the hardest part isnâ€™t writing codeâ€”itâ€™s building momentum, finding users, and reaching revenue. Thatâ€™s where most projects die. Indie10k exists to change that.
## Our Approach: The Growth Gym

Growth isnâ€™t magic, itâ€™s muscle. And muscles are built with reps.

Thatâ€™s why Indie10k works like a gym for indie hackers:

- 
**Reps** ? Bite-sized growth exercises you can complete quickly.

- 
**Arcs** ? The bigger picture, guided by the TenK 6 methodology (List, Pick, Ship, Ask, Measure, Share).

Do enough reps, and your growth muscle compounds. Follow arcs, and youâ€™ll build real momentum toward $10k MRR.
## Expect Imperfection (and Progress)

I ship fast, sometimes messy. Features will change, bugs will appear, and new ideas will roll out often. Thatâ€™s the pointâ€”Indie10k is alive, not static.

If youâ€™re here, youâ€™re part of that journey. Your feedback will shape what this product becomes.
## Whatâ€™s Next

- 
Reps will keep expanding with sharper, actionable growth exercises.

- 
Arcs will guide disciplined indie hackers through the TenK 6 loop.

- 
And the core product will keep evolving around one question: *what actually helps indie devs grow?*

## Join Us from Day 1

This is technically our **first real sale day**. The beta period is done. If youâ€™ve been watching from the sidelines, nowâ€™s the time to join in.

Because this isnâ€™t just softwareâ€”itâ€™s your growth gym.
