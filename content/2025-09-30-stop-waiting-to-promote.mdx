I used to tell myself:
"I'll share this once I finish building feature XYZ."

Sounds responsible, right? Ship the "complete" version before talking about it.
But here's the trap: there's no such thing as "finished."

Every feature leads to another idea, another tweak, another "just one more thing."
You never feel ready. So you don't share. And your momentum stalls.

## The Truth About "Perfect"

The truth: users don't need perfect. They need usable.
If it runs without breaking, it's worth putting in front of people.

Every time I've published my "incomplete" changes—rough edges, ugly buttons, missing polish—I got faster feedback, new users, and a shot of momentum.
Every time I held back until it was "ready," I lost weeks of compounding growth.

Momentum loves shipping. Perfection kills it.

## The Mindset Shift

So here's the mindset shift:

Don't wait for the perfect milestone.

Share as soon as it's usable, even if it feels half-baked.

Let your community grow with you, not after you.

Your product will never be done.
But your momentum will die if you keep pausing for perfection.

Ship. Publish. Keep moving.
