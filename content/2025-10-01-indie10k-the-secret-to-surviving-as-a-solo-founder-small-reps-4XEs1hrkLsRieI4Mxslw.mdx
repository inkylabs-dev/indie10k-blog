I tried following heavy growth frameworks before. They looked smart. They worked… for about two days. Then client calls, bugs, and life happened. Framework abandoned. Product stalled.

Here’s the truth: indie devs don’t quit because we can’t think big. We quit because we can’t keep up with big.

That’s why I built [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com) around bite-sized Reps. One action. Clear, small, fast.

- 
Not “fix your onboarding.” → Just ask 3 users what broke.

- 
Not “run SEO.” → Just pick one keyword you can rank this week.

- 
Not “launch on every platform.” → Just share one post where you already hang out.

- 
Not "build your funnel" → Just write a single blog post solving real user pain.

These aren’t hacks. They’re survival. Small wins keep you moving when discipline runs out. Streaks stack. Momentum compounds.

Indie10k is basically a gym for growth. Every day: one rep. No excuses. No graveyard.

Question for you: If you had to pick just one tiny action to move your product forward today, what would it be?
