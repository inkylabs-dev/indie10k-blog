For the past few months, Indie10k has been running in open beta. You've seen me ship imperfect code, experiment in public, and chase down bugs with duct tape. That was the messy but necessary warm-up.

Today, that chapter closes. Open Beta ends. And in its place: **Day 1** of Indie10k as a product you can actually buy.

## Our Goal: Help Indie Devs Win

Indie10k is built on a simple mission: to help indie developers escape the graveyard of half-finished projects and actually grow something sustainable.

You already know the hardest part isn't writing codeâ€”it's building momentum, finding users, and reaching revenue. That's where most projects die. Indie10k exists to change that.



## Our Approach: The Growth Gym

Growth isn't magic, it's muscle. And muscles are built with reps.

That's why Indie10k works like a gym for indie hackers:

-   **Reps** â†’ Bite-sized growth exercises you can complete quickly.
    
-   **Arcs** â†’ The bigger picture, guided by the TenK 6 methodology (List, Pick, Ship, Ask, Measure, Share).
    

Do enough reps, and your growth muscle compounds. Follow arcs, and you'll build real momentum toward $10k MRR.



## Expect Imperfection (and Progress)

I ship fast, sometimes messy. Features will change, bugs will appear, and new ideas will roll out often. That's the pointâ€”Indie10k is alive, not static.

If you're here, you're part of that journey. Your feedback will shape what this product becomes.



## What's Next

-   Reps will keep expanding with sharper, actionable growth exercises.
    
-   Arcs will guide disciplined indie hackers through the TenK 6 loop.
    
-   And the core product will keep evolving around one question: _what actually helps indie devs grow?_
    

## Join Us from Day 1

This is technically our **first real sale day**. The beta period is done. If you've been watching from the sidelines, now's the time to join in.

Because this isn't just softwareâ€”it's your growth gym.
