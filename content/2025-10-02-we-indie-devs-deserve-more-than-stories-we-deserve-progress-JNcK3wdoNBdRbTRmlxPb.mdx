Most advice for indie developers comes from the outside.

Communities, books, success storiesâ€”those are other peopleâ€™s playbooks.

Indie10k is unique. It doesnâ€™t hand you stories. It gives you reps. And you do reps.

**The Analogy That Works**

In fitness, you donâ€™t get strong by reading about squats.

You get strong by showing up and doing repsâ€”over and over.

Growth is the same.

Every rep in Indie10k is a tiny, bite-sized action you can complete today.

One rep doesnâ€™t look like much. Ten feels like progress. A hundred becomes a streak.

And streaks build results you can actually see.

The method is proven. Youâ€™ve seen these actions scattered across blog posts, tweets, and threads.

The difference?

Indie10k turns them into action, not just ideas you scroll past.

**The Indie Dev Reality**

We, indie devs who havenâ€™t even earned $100 yet, are the true minority of the saas world.

But we outnumber the solo founders whoâ€™ve hit $10k MRR.

Weâ€™re enthusiastic zealots. We dream big.

But we also surrender too easily.

Weâ€™ve tasted failure more times than we care to admit.

We deserve better than failure on repeat.

We deserve a system that makes progress inevitable.

**Why This Matters**

[Indie10k](https://indie10k.com) is not a book. Not a lecture. Not a community that cheers you on from the sidelines.

Itâ€™s a gym for your startup journey.

Every day: one rep.

Simple. Solid. Actionable.

Your streak is your story.

Your reps are your results.

Success is in your hands.

You make your own $10k dream a reality.

ðŸ‘‰ This is why Indie10k exists. Not to inspire. Not to teach. Not to encourage you. But to give indie devs a better resultâ€”one rep at a time.
