I just published the first draft of the **TenK Manifesto** — a declaration for indie founders who believe in showing up daily, stacking small wins, and compounding their way to $10k MRR.

👉 Draft lives here: [Google Doc link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10OjVTWtOpw_h6XZnXTOyZpcU6E4f44On-0bNwFFDQ7Y/edit?tab=t.0)

It’s inspired by the spirit of the Agile Manifesto, but rewritten for indie devs who don’t want theory, hype, or fluff — just consistency, reps, and proof.

**How you can join in:**

- 
If you’d like to **co-author**, just leave a Google Doc review comment with your suggested changes. If I adopt it, your name will be added to the “Authors” section.

- 
If you’d like to **sign it**, simply submit your signatory [here](https://indie10k.com/manifesto) with your name, email, and (optional) your product name + link. I’ll add you as a signatory.

This is meant to be a living document — something we can all stand behind, not just my words.

Would you sign the TenK Manifesto? ✍️
