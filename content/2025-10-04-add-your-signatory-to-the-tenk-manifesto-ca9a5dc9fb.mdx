We are uncovering better ways of reaching $10k MRR as indie founders

by showing up daily, compounding small wins, and helping others do the same.

Through this work we have come to value:

Consistent practice over perfect strategy

Small, shippable reps over grand unstarted plans

Momentum through streaks over bursts of unsustainable effort

Direct customer conversations over secondhand advice

Evidence from action over assumptions from theory

Sharing progress openly over building alone in silence

That is, while there is value in the items on the right,

we value the items on the left more.

If you agree these believes, add your signatories at [https://indie10k.com/manifesto](https://indie10k.com/manifesto)

Let us make $10k a movement and help more saas founders make their dream true!
