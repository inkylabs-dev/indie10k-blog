I’ve seen tons of indie hackers swear by cold email —  
“Just send 100 emails a day and you’ll get users!”  

Easy to say when you’re not the one sweating over the *Send* button.  

Every time I try, my brain says:  
*You’ll look spammy.*  
*They’ll hate it.*  
*You’re bothering them.*  

So I stall.  
I rewrite the draft.  
I check the grammar.  
I even redesign the logo.  
Basically, I do everything **except** send the email.

It’s okay to be scared.

That fear means you care.  
You’re not trying to scam anyone — you’re trying to help.  
You just don’t want to sound like a robot with an agenda.

So here’s the trick that helped me move past it:

### The Five-Step Cure for Cold Reach Anxiety

1. **Type the email.**  
   Don’t aim for perfect. Just write the words.

2. **Type the content.**  
   Tell them what you’re working on and *why it might help them*.  
   Keep it honest. Keep it human.

3. **Hover over “Send.”**

4. **Close one eyelid.**  
   (Yes, like you’re defusing a bomb.)

5. **Click.**

That’s it.  

After you’ve done this a few times, you’ll skip step 4 automatically.  
The fear fades. The motion stays.

Most cold emails?  
Crickets.  

And that’s perfectly fine.  
You’re not collecting replies — you’re building reps.  

Each “no reply” teaches your brain that rejection doesn’t kill you.  
Each click builds your confidence muscle.  

Because one day, after enough silent sends,  
someone *will* reply —  
and you’ll realize cold outreach isn’t about courage.  
It’s about **consistency**.  

The win isn’t in the answer.  
It’s in the send.
