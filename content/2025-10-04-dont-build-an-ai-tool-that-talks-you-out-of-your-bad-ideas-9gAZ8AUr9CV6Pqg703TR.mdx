You know those late-night "genius" startup ideas that feel world-changing at 2 AM but dumb by breakfast?

Yeah. I built a tool for that.
👉 [https://indie10k.com/tools/dontbuild](https://indie10k.com/tools/dontbuild)

You type your startup idea.
It instantly roasts it — with brutal honesty and a touch of sarcasm.
Example of making a verdict for itself:

“You’re building a tool for a problem that’s already solved by friends and self-doubt. Expect endless support calls, a lack of users, and a major time sink!”
#### 💡 Why I built it

Because most idea validators out there are too polite.

They tell you “maybe you should survey 100 people,” or “run a waitlist.”
But let’s be real — what we often need is not *validation*, it’s a *reality check.*

I wanted a quick, funny way to kill bad ideas early and move on to the ones that survive the punchline.
#### ⚙️ How it works

- 
Type your idea.

- 
Hit “Validate.”

- 
Get roasted by AI.

- 
Laugh, cry, and maybe... build it anyway to prove it wrong.

#### 🎯 The goal

It’s not anti-building. It’s **pro-focus.**
Every indie hacker has a graveyard of half-built apps.
Maybe this tool saves you from digging one more.

If you’ve ever said “I have too many ideas,”
you probably need **Don’t Build** more than caffeine.
