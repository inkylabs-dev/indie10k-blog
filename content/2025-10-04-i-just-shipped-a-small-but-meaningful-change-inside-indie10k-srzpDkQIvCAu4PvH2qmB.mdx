Now, your daily growth rep depends on **which track you’re on**.

Instead of pulling a rep from the general pool, the system looks at your track and picks reps relevant to your current stage.

Say, you're post-launched, you might see a rep to build a tiny shippable tool in 24h to expand funnel, but you won't see this task in idea validation phase.

That’s it — same flow, same simplicity — but suddenly the experience feels much more personal.

Under the hood, it’s literally just a tag filter.
No new buttons. No extra UI.
You pick your track → reps adapt automatically.

What looks *simple* now took me at least ten long chats with ChatGPT over three days to *become* simple.
We explored “repsets” like in fitness apps, AI-generated reps, dynamic difficulty scaling…
but every idea added complexity that broke the “SLC” rule — **Simple, Lovable, Complete**.

So I killed them all.
And that killing was the hard part.

Indie10k keeps proving this lesson:
simplicity isn’t a design choice — it’s a daily battle.
Every idea that feels smart is secretly asking, “Do you really need me?”

Curious:
If you track user stages or milestones in your product, how do you keep it simple without making it generic?
