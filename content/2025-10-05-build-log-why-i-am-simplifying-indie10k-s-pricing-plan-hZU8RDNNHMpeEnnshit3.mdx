When I first priced Indie10k, I thought adding more tiers and fancy AI features would make it feel “complete.”  

Turns out, it only made things *harder to pick up* — both for users and for me.

Over time, I realized the people Indie10k serves best are **solo indie founders** — people like me, who just want to show up every day, build streaks, and make progress.  

Not enterprise teams. Not feature hunters. Just builders trying to reach their first $10k MRR.

So today, I stripped everything down.

**🏗️ Builder — $9/mo**  

For early-stage founders still validating and shipping.  

I know how it feels — budget is tight, priorities shift daily.  

Since I removed a lot of "good to have" stuff, shiny six-step framework, fluffy AI layers. It makes things just less harder to ppl to understand.

Now it’s just the essentials: a fully working system for daily reps and growth momentum.

Builder who is in early stage (maybe not earning a dime) would need this.

**⚙️ Hacker — $19/mo**  

For when your project starts bringing in revenue.  

It unlocks revenue-related reps and keeps you growing in sync with your progress.  

It's a tiny cap to add, just like you have changed your hat from "longly builder" to "verified growth hacker".

Simple rule: 

no revenue → Builder. 

revenue → Hacker. 

That’s it.

**🚫 Crew Plan — gone.**  

Nah. I killed it. Teams can wait.  

Indie10k is about *solo founders* staying consistent — one day, one rep at a time.

**💬 Tiny detail:**  

I also added a small sidebar block showing your 7 day free-trial progress — a little visual nudge to keep you motivated and aware of where you stand.

The new pricing isn’t about making less — it’s about **removing friction**.  

The easier it is for indie devs to start, the more streaks we’ll see.  

Momentum compounds — and that’s what this whole project is about.

Do you think $9/mo feels fair for a daily streak and growth rep system?  

Would love to hear your take, especially if you’re still early in your indie journey.
