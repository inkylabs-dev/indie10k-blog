Iâ€™m proposing a new day for all indie hackers: **Indie Growth Day** â€” every **October 10**.

A day where we pause, look back, and celebrate the milestones weâ€™ve earned â€” however small or big.

#### ðŸ’¡ Why October 10?

Because **$10K MRR** is the milestone that started it all.

Itâ€™s the north star most indie hackers aim for â€” not because of the money,

but because it means **you made something people actually pay for**.

$10K = freedom.

$10K = validation.

$10K = proof that your ideas, persistence, and weird experiments actually worked.

#### ðŸš€ How to Celebrate

- 

Share your **growth story** â€” the messy, honest one.

- 

Post your **numbers**, even if itâ€™s $0 â†’ $100.

- 

Thank the people who gave you feedback, tested your product, or tweeted your launch.

- 

Reflect on what really moved the needle this year.

Letâ€™s make October 10 a yearly ritual for the indie community.

A day not of hype â€” but of progress.
