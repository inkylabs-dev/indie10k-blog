Today I didn’t touch a single new feature — and that’s the point.

I spent the whole day optimizing one critical thing: **helping indie devs find their first 100 users.**

That means:

- 
Enhancing existing Reps (tiny, actionable growth tasks).

- 
Making instructions sharper, shorter, clearer.

- 
Shrinking task size so it feels doable — not overwhelming.

No code. No UI changes. Just pure clarity work.
It’s funny how the most meaningful improvements often look invisible from the outside.

If a user opens [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com) tomorrow and feels, *“Oh, this rep actually feels easier to start,”* — that’s the real feature shipped today.
