**If a stranger can’t repeat what you do after one read, you don’t have a value prop — you have a riddle.**

Most founders overestimate how clear their message is. We live inside our product, so every word feels obvious. But to outsiders, our copy reads like static. The curse of knowledge makes us blind to how confusing we sound.

A good value proposition isn’t clever. It’s clear. It’s something your mom could repeat at dinner and sound like she gets it. The goal is instant understanding — not poetic phrasing, not startup buzzwords, not “AI-powered platform for X.”

You get one sentence to hook someone before their brain bails. Make it so stupidly clear they can’t misunderstand it. “Helps indie hackers get their first 100 users.” “Turns your notes into tweets.” “Records meetings and writes summaries.” That’s the level of clarity that spreads.

If you have to explain it, it’s not simple enough. Rewrite until even a distracted stranger scrolling on the toilet gets it.

Strangers might be curious about how your SaaS works. But they should understand what the business does in one read.
