Every time I remove a button, [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com?utm_source=indiehackers) feels lighter — and better.

I used to think more options meant more power. Turns out, it just meant more hesitation.
Users don’t need to think twice; they just want to *do*.

So I simplified again in project library page.
No more “Do it” or “Swap it.”
Just one clear choice: **“I want to do this rep!”**

Behind the scenes, it still works the same magic. But on the surface — pure calm.

It’s a small change, but every pixel of friction you remove is a small gift to your user.
They don’t thank you for fewer buttons, but they *feel* it.

I keep reminding myself:

Complexity is the tax you pay for saying “yes” too often.

Today, I said **no** — and [indie10k](https://indie10k.com) said **thank you**.
