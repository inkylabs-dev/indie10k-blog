Let s be honest, most of us have fallen into the *tutorial trap. *You watch one video… then another… and suddenly you've "learned" five frameworks but built nothing. 😅
That's exactly why we built [**Codenhack**](https://codenhack.com), a place where learning to code means **actually building something.**

Here’s what makes it different 👇
**Interactive Courses**
Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, Python, Java, and even modern frameworks like  Vue, React, all directly in your browser.
No setup, no fluff, just type and see it run live.
**Real Projects**
Projects designed to make you *apply* what you learn, because that's where real learning happens.
**Creative Hacks**
Build anything you want from scratch. Experiment, showcase your work, and get instant feedback from the community.
**Stay Motivated**
Earn XP, badges, and streaks as you learn. Compete with friends or just challenge yourself to keep the streak alive.
**AI Coding Assistant**
Stuck on a concept? Ask for help instantly without leaving your workspace.
**Community &amp; Blog**
Share what you build, write about your journey, and connect with other learners and builders.

We started [**Codenhack**](https://codenhack.com) because we believe you don't *really* learn by watching, you learn by doing, breaking things, and fixing them again. 🛠️

**Early beta access, no limits, no cost, so it's your chance to jump in and build something real.**
