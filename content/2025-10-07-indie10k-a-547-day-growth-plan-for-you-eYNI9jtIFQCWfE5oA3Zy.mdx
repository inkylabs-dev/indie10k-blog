Just joking. 😅
[**Indie10k**](https://indie10k.com?utm_source=indiehackers) isn’t another “get to $10k MRR in 30 days” kind of platform.

It’s *nofluff*.
It doesn’t lie.
It doesn’t promise magic.

But here’s what it *does* offer — **daily reps**.
And with those, that same $10k MRR goal *is* reachable — in about **18 months (547 days)**.

Now do the math.
Each rep = one small, concrete action that brings in *a few* users.
Some may get you several paid users. Some may not.
But on average — say **one user per rep** — with a $20/mo plan,
that’s **547 users × $20 = $10,940 MRR**.

Some growth zealots may even choose to run extra reps on an energetic day.
That’s fine — momentum loves momentum.

No funnels. No gurus. No fake dashboards.
Just you, one rep at a time.

💪 *Ship. Ask. Measure. Repeat.*
That’s the real growth plan.
