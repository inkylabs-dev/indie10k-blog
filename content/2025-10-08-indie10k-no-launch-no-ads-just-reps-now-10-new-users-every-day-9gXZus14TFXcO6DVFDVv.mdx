In September 2025, I promised myself to do one thing for my SaaS every day.
Just one rep.

Day one, I sent a cold email.
No reply.
Day two, nothing.
Day five, someone said, “cool.”

That “cool” turned into a chat.
The chat turned into a user.
And somehow, momentum was back.

I didn’t change my strategy.
I just stopped waiting for motivation
and started counting reps.

Now I have 10+ user coming daily (that could mean thousands of users if I do daily reps for a few months).

Momentum hides in small actions.
Do one today.

What about you? 😉
