I made it.
The video shorts sits quietly on the [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com?utm_source=indiehackers) landing page when you scroll down.

No fancy studio. No mic. No lighting. No camera crew.
Just me, **an iPhone**, and a bunch of nerves, re-recording and hit upload.

I’m not an influencer.
I’m not even a “talker” type person.
I'm introvert.
I write, I code, I build — that’s where I’m comfortable.
But I knew this time, hiding behind the product wouldn’t work.
If Indie10k is about *real indie devs building in public*, then I had to show up too.

So I practiced.
My tongue twisted.
I re-recorded small parts, stitched them together. It looked bad when joined together.
Did it again — tried one take. Just a few sentences.
Cut **20+ times**.
Done. Good enough.
Published it to my tiny YouTube channel (less than 10 subs).

Then I embedded it into the website.
Polished the behavior so it **doesn’t block browsing**,
and added a small **“Don’t show again”** button — because I hate intrusive stuff too.

A few days later, someone on Reddit left this comment:

“at first the pop-up video kinda made me want to leave the site. Then I decided hmmm it’s not effecting performance let me click play. Smoothly played the video on mobile while still being able to browse. Nice work. The video actually swayed my opinion for that matter.”

He (or she?) added:

“You got solid character. When I saw it was actually you and not some bs influencer or AI- the trust was gained immediately.”

That hit me hard.
The thing I was most scared to show became the thing that built the most trust.
### 💡 Lesson Learned

You don’t need a studio, script, or swagger.
You just need to be *real*.
People don’t want perfection — they want to see the human who actually built the thing.

If your product is real, show your face.
It's where the trust starts to build.
And trust, is the foundation of your business.

I'm glad I did it right.
