Today’s growth rep: [Say It So Clearly a Stranger Gets It](https://indie10k.com/reps/say-it-so-clearly-a-stranger-gets-it-c89b3b73-7026-46e7-a54b-1b61d312a8c7)

A stranger messaged me after visiting [**indie10k.com**](http://indie10k.com):

“I’m struggling to understand what the product does.
The H1 says *personal growth for indie devs* — sounds like habits or mindset.
The H2 says *for your product* — so... is it marketing? Confusing.”

He nailed it.
My message wasn’t clear.

So I rewrote just two lines:

- The daily growth gym for indie devs.
+ Grow Your SaaS One Daily Action at a Time

- Small, actionable exercises that help your product grow. No fluff. No overwhelm. Just momentum.
+ Stop guessing what to do next. Indie10k gives you one clear growth task every day — small enough to finish, powerful enough to compound.

I showed him again.
He said: *“Wayyyyy better.”*

Tiny copy change. Big clarity gain.
No new features. No redesign.
Just words that finally say what the product actually does.

Momentum doesn’t come from shipping more.
It comes from saying it clearer.

**Your turn:**
Ask one stranger what they *think* your landing page means — then rewrite until they can repeat it in one sentence.

And if you want a system that helps you revisit your copy (and growth strategy) regularly —
👉 **Use **[**Indie10k**](https://indie10k.com?utm_source=indiehackers) make clear messaging part of your daily reps.
