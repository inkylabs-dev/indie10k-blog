Yesterday, I posted a short [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1o2j9gh/i_deleted_all_ai_features_and_user_growth_went_up/) on Reddit:

“I deleted all AI features… and user growth went up.”

I didn’t expect much. It was just a quick build-in-public note about how simplifying my SaaS, [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com), led to better metrics.
But the thread exploded — 32k views, 60+ upvotes, 50+ comments, and some of the best feedback I’ve ever received.

So, here’s what I learned from that chaos.
### 1. People are not against AI — they’re against being *bossed around* by it.

When I first built Indie10k, I thought AI would be the ultimate growth coach for founders.
A “smart assistant” that tells you what to do to grow your SaaS.

Turns out, that was exactly the problem.

One Redditor nailed it:

“I don’t want AI to be my boss.”

I was like (phew).
I'm glad I pivoted to something that didn't *disempower* users.

It’s not that AI is bad — it’s that the *framing* was wrong.
People want to feel in control of their growth, not managed by a machine.
### 2. Users crave *clarity*, not “intelligence.”

One comment stood out:

“It’s simply cognitive load effect — the less you load on a page, the more signups you get.”

That line might as well be my new product philosophy.
When I stripped out the AI features — the chat, the suggestions, the “smart” tasks — the app became one clean page with one button.

Suddenly, new users got it.
No more hesitation. No more “What does this do?” moments.

Sometimes, intelligence confuses. Simplicity converts.
### 3. AI adds cost and cynicism.

Another comment hit a nerve:

“I’m tired of AI everything. I click a button, wait, then get hit with a new paywall.”

That one made me laugh — then wince.
Because that’s *exactly* what happened with my earlier prototypes.
AI drove up my costs (OpenAI tokens), which forced me to add paywalls that I didn’t even believe in.

Removing AI not only simplified UX — it made pricing fairer.
No token cost, no surprise charges, just one simple subscription.
And for my target users — indie developers still finding their footing — that fairness matters more than “smarts.”
### 4. Simplicity builds *trust*.

I never realized how much clutter erodes credibility until users started telling me,

“I finally get what your app does now.”

It’s almost embarrassing to admit how many hours I spent designing clever AI features when a single sentence and button were all I needed.

And when I added a small personal video to the landing page — something I was nervous about — people connected instantly.
One user said:

“Seeing your real face instead of an influencer or AI instantly built trust.”

I used to think simplicity was boring.
Now I see it’s the purest signal of confidence.
### 5. The best AI is structure.

If there’s one recurring insight across all comments, it’s this:
AI isn’t the *value*, structure is.

Users don’t want a model to think for them — they want a *system* that helps them think better.
Something that makes it easy to show up every day and take one clear step forward.

That’s literally what Indie10k evolved into:
A “growth gym” that gives founders one actionable rep per day — small enough to finish, powerful enough to compound.

Like a fitness app, but for SaaS growth.
### 6. The meta-lesson: Don’t “AI it” just to look smart.

One of my favorite comments said:

“Most AI add-ons fail because they add noise instead of leverage.”

Couldn’t agree more.
Adding AI shouldn’t be a badge — it should be a mechanic.
Something that amplifies a proven user behavior, not replaces it.

So now, my new rule is simple:
**If a feature doesn’t move retention by double digits, strip it.**
### 7. The emotional side: fear and clarity.

When I deleted all the AI code, I was anxious.
It felt like killing the “wow” factor of my app.
But what replaced that was something more powerful — clarity.

I learned that *humility beats hype*.
You don’t need to impress your users. You need to help them progress.

And ironically, once I did that, user signups and retention both went up.
### My takeaway

AI didn’t fail me. I failed to use it responsibly.
It made me forget that the job of a product is to *help humans act*, not automate their agency.

The real magic isn’t artificial intelligence — it’s human discipline, guided by smart structure.
### Your turn

So I’ll pass the question back to you:
**What' the AI feature in your SaaS and where is the line between “assist” and “replace” in your SaaS?**
