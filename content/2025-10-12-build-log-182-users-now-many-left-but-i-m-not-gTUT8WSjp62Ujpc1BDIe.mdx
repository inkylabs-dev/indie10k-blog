I just crossed **182 users** for Indie10k.

Good news: people *do* come.
Bad news: many **leave after one rep**.

It’s that classic indie problem — they sign up, poke around, do something once, and disappear.
No hate. I’ve done it to other products too.

But I’ve been staring at this pattern, and it’s not discouraging — it’s fascinating.
Because this isn’t “nobody cares.”
It’s **“people tried once.”**

That means the *onboarding works*.
The concept is clear enough to get a “yes.”
Now the game is: turn that *one yes* into *a habit*.

I have a few ideas to fix the high user churn.
My rational brain says: test one small loop at a time.
My founder brain says: make it *feel alive*.
My gut says: don’t overbuild. Keep it simple. Let one spark catch.
So my decision is,  do a few user interviews and let user tell me what happens.

Somewhere between tired and curious.
This is the 20th time I’ve seen a metric drop… but this time I don’t feel panic.
It’s just feedback.

Indie10k isn’t another dashboard.
It’s a mirror for indie devs who are trying to stay consistent — including me.
If I can get **one person** to return for their 2nd rep because of something I built,
that’s the moment the app becomes much "realer".

So yeah — 182 users, high churn.
But I’m still here.
Still doing [my daily rep](https://indie10k.com?utm_source=indiehackers).
