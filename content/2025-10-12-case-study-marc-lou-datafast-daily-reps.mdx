Let’s be honest — we all love reading those [“0 → $5K MRR” stories](https://newsletter.marclou.com/p/how-i-grew-my-saas-to-5k-mrr).  
But the real magic isn’t in the $5K. It’s in the **days between** — the invisible stretch of small, consistent moves that stacked up until something clicked.

That’s what we call **Daily Reps** at Indie10k.  
And when you look closely, that’s exactly what Marc Lou did with DataFast.

----------

### The Boring, Brilliant Part Nobody Talks About

Marc didn’t wake up one morning with a viral launch or a secret growth hack.  
He built [DataFast](https://datafa.st) piece by piece — showing up every single day, testing, tweaking, and sharing his progress even when it felt like nobody cared.

He tweeted his updates. He answered DMs. He listened to feedback.  
He watched users drop off, then built new features to bring them back.  
At one point, churn was almost 33%. He could’ve quit — but instead, he turned it into a rep.

He wasn’t chasing “hockey stick growth.” He was building _muscle memory_.  
And muscle memory comes from reps — small ones, done often.

----------

### What His Daily Reps Looked Like

If you break down his story, you start to see a rhythm emerge.  
He wasn’t just coding. He was doing small, compound actions every day.

Every day he **shared progress publicly** — even when the numbers were small. That’s how early users began to trust him. Transparency became marketing.

Every day he **talked to users**, collecting feedback and building based on real conversations. He even built a chat box into every page, because he knew friction hides in silence.

Every day he **refined onboarding**, cutting steps that distracted from the “aha” moment — helping users reach value faster.

And when he shipped new features, he didn’t just code them quietly.  
He made them _shareable_. Features like a real-time globe didn’t just solve a need — they made users want to screenshot and spread the word.

Those are Daily Reps.  
Not glamorous, but deeply compounding.

----------

### The Flywheel Behind the $5K

By repeating those small cycles — build, share, listen, improve — Marc built something stronger than a one-off launch. He built a _system_ that compounds effort.

Within a year, DataFast reached over 400 paying users and $5,338 in MRR.  
But what’s more important is that the engine he built keeps running.  
Because the process — the rhythm — was the product.

That’s the lesson most indie founders miss. You don’t scale a SaaS by doing more work; you scale by repeating the right work. Over and over. With less friction each time.

### What Indie10k Adds to the Mix

At Indie10k, we help founders turn that messy rhythm into a repeatable one.  
Instead of guessing what to do next, you wake up each day with **one clear, actionable rep** — the smallest next step that compounds toward your growth goal.

Marc had to design his own reps from scratch. You don’t have to.

Indie10k gives you a library of proven reps — share posts, feedback prompts, mini launches, onboarding tweaks — along with a system to **track, repeat, and improve** them.  
You get daily focus, community accountability, and measurable progress — all built around the same muscle Marc built: consistency.

### Build Your Own $5K Rep Engine

If you want Marc’s outcome, you don’t need his product.  
You need his process.

Start showing up every day. Share one update. Ask one user something. Ship one improvement. Then do it again tomorrow.

That’s how compounding starts — one rep at a time.  
That’s how Indie10k helps indie founders grow.
