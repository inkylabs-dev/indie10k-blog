Momentum isn’t a feeling — it’s visible in the commits.

Every time I push code to [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com) repo, I leave behind proof of growth.
I started treating *growth evidence* like part of the codebase itself:

- 
Add a blog (SSR).

- 
Add an Indie Hackers post link.

- 
Add key metrics as constants or logs in code.

Now `git log` literally shows my startup’s growth journey.
I can rewind to any moment and see what moved the needle that week.

It’s not just “Growth Hacking.”
It’s **Growth-As-Code.**
