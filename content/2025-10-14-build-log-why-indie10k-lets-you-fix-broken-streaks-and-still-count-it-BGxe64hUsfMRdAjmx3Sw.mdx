Today I made a small but meaningful tweak to [**Indie10k**](https://indie10k.com).
Users can now **fix broken streaks** from the past seven days.

That’s it — no fireworks. But it changes the tone of how I want users to think about showing up.
### Why this matters

Most habit apps — *Duolingo*, *Headspace*, *Notion streaks* — build on **punishment loops**.
You miss a day? You lose your streak. The app shames you with sad icons or broken flames, and even, words, worst ever.

Indie10k isn’t built that way.
This product is about **building growth momentum**, not performing discipline for an algorithm.

Because real indie builders have messy weeks.
You ship on Monday and Tuesday, then your kid gets sick. Or a deploy breaks.
It happens.
Two days of build, one day of growth — that’s often the real rhythm.

So, I built this feature not to erase the past, but to **keep your story continuous**.
### How it works

If you missed a few days, you can now open the **Fix Streak** page.
It shows the past seven days of your reps.
You can pick any missed day and complete a “make-up rep.”

That rep still counts — because the value isn’t in *when* you log it, but that you **reflected and did the work**.

It’s like journaling yesterday’s growth. It still builds the muscle.
### Why I limited it to 7 days

Fixing streaks is a *last resort*, not a cheat code.

If you haven’t touched your project for two weeks, you’re not fixing — you’re restarting.
Momentum fades after a week. That’s just how attention works.

So I capped the fix window to **7 days**.
Beyond that, the system resets naturally — not to punish, but to give you a fresh start.
### What I learned

After launching this, I noticed one thing immediately:
When people feel **permission instead of guilt**, they re-engage faster.

This update isn’t about generosity — it’s about psychology.
People don’t build habits through shame; they build them through **agency**.

You can’t guilt someone into consistency.
You can only help them recover their rhythm.
### Reflection

I’ve come to think of Indie10k less like a gym and more like a **growth diary**.
If you miss a few pages, you can still go back and fill them in.
It’s your story — and it’s better with continuity.

Fix streaks if you must.
But remember: the real win is still showing up today.

💬 **Your turn:**
How do you recover when your own streak breaks — rebuild, restart, or ignore it?
Let me know.
