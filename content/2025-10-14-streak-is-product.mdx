### The moment I realized I was drifting

Last week, I found myself deep in the weeds of building new features for Indie10k. I was adding AI-generated content, automations, and all sorts of bells and whistles. On paper, these features sounded like a dreamâ€”more engagement, more users, more value.

But as I coded, I felt a creeping unease. Was I building *the right* product? Or just a fancier one?

### The original vision: streaks as the product

When I started Indie10k, the core idea was simple: create a daily habit for indie hackers to share what they built. The streakâ€”the uninterrupted chain of daily postsâ€”was the real product. It was the glue that kept people coming back, day after day.

Everything else was secondary. The community, the features, the AI toolsâ€”they were just means to support the streak.

### The danger of feature bloat

Itâ€™s easy to get distracted by shiny new features. AI-generated summaries, badges, leaderboardsâ€”they all seem like theyâ€™ll boost engagement. But if they overshadow the core habit, they risk diluting the productâ€™s essence.

I realized I was at risk of building a feature factory, not a habit-forming product.

### Rediscovering the streak doctrine

So I paused. I stripped back the new features and focused on the streak experience. How can I make it easier, more rewarding, and more meaningful to keep the streak alive?

I talked to users, watched their behavior, and refined the core loop. The AI features? Theyâ€™ll come later, but only if they serve the streak.

### The lesson: the streak is the product

This week was a reminder that products arenâ€™t just collections of features. Theyâ€™re habits, emotions, and rituals. For Indie10k, the streak is the product. Everything else is noise.

By focusing on what truly matters, we build products that last.

*Because the streak is the product. Everything else is noise.*
