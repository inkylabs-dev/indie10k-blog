Every indie founder eventually builds their own personal stack — the handful of tools you reach for no matter what project you’re starting.

Here’s mine.  
The same set I use across **Indie10k** and the other microsaas products.  
They help me move from **idea → validation → launch → growth** without overthinking.



## 🧩 Step 1: Validate the Idea

When a new idea hits, I don’t open VSCode.  
I open **Presale.services** — my shortcut to see if anyone will _actually pay_ for the idea.  
It spins up a presale page with a real Stripe checkout in minutes.

If I want to compare messaging or collect interest without payments, I’ll switch to **Prelaunch.com** or **Tally.so**.  
The goal is simple: see intent, not noise.

> “Validation isn’t a survey. It’s a checkout.”

That single mental shift saved me from building three products no one would buy.



## 💬 Step 2: Talk to Users

I still use **Tally.so** for early feedback — it feels like a Google Form that grew up.  
When I want higher engagement (for example, when testing feature names or pricing copy), I use **Typeform**.  
It’s small stuff like this that makes user conversations feel human, not transactional.

I also plug Tally forms into **Beehiiv** or **ConvertKit** for instant follow-up emails, so conversations don’t die after one response.



## 🧱 Step 3: Build a Home

Every idea needs a “hello world” page.  
I use:

-   🧩 **[ship.fast](https://ship.fast)** — best if I want something up _today_. Comes with auth, pricing, and markdown blog out of the box.
    
-   🧩 **[opensaas.sh](https://opensaas.sh)** — when I’m sure I’ll grow it into a full SaaS. It’s open-source, production-ready, and Stripe-friendly.
    
-   ✨ **Framer** — when I need a prettier, static marketing site fast.
    

What matters isn’t the framework — it’s that the first deploy happens within 24 hours of validation. Sometimes, I even just ask v0/claude to build a landing page and call it a ship. :)

> If I can’t launch in a day, I’m building too much.



## 💳 Step 4: Accept Payments Early

My rule: connect a payment before adding any features.

For Indie10k, I tested both **[Stripe](https://stripe.com)** and **Lemon Squeezy**.  
Stripe gives total control — perfect for API-heavy products.  
Lemon Squeezy wins for ease and automatic VAT handling.

Even one $1 payment changes how you see the product. It shifts from “project” to “business.”



## ⚙️ Step 5: Deploy Fast

**Vercel** has become my go-to host — it detects your repo, deploys automatically, and includes logs.  
If I need something longer-term, **Render.com**, **[Railway.app](https://railway.app)** or even [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) take over.

I try to avoid multi-step pipelines early on.  
A no-click deploy (e.g. a git push) removes friction and forces focus on building, not infrastructure.



## 📊 Step 6: Track the Right Numbers

I use [**Google Analytics**](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) for privacy-non-friendly analytics - powerful, fastest, but needs cookie banner.
I use [**Plausible.io**](https://plausible.io) for privacy-friendly analytics — simple, fast, no cookie banner.  
When I need deeper event tracking (like how many users click “Complete Rep”), I use [**PostHog**](https://posthog.com).

The goal is to measure _momentum_, not vanity.  
How many users came back?  
How many finished a rep?  
That’s growth-as-code.



## ✉️ Step 7: Keep Conversations Warm

Once a user signs up, I never leave them hanging.

[**ConvertKit**](https://kit.com) is my default for onboarding emails and daily growth nudges.  
For newsletters and long-form storytelling, I switched to [**Beehiiv**](https://beehiiv.com). It’s faster to write, prettier to read, and lets me build a small media loop around the product. But [**SubStack**](https://substack.com) is still great but with less control.



## 🧠 Step 8: Write for Google, Not Robots

I still believe SEO is compounding magic — if done right.

[**NeuralText**](https://neuraltext.com) helps me find real keyword gaps in my niche (“indie growth reps”, “build-in-public streaks”, etc.), while [**Ahrefs Webmaster Tools**](https://ahrefs.com) monitors backlinks and site health.

Every post on [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com)'s blog is optimized manually — but the ideas are still human.  
That’s what keeps trust high.



## 📣 Step 9: Launch in Public

When it’s ready, I go loud:

-   **Product Hunt** for visibility
    
-   **Indie Hackers** for ongoing build logs

-   **Redit** for engaging potential users
    
-   **X / Twitter** for micro-stories that link back to my metrics
    

The launch is never about “going viral.”  
It’s about building the next feedback loop.
(but who wouldn't love "going viral"? lol)



## 📈 Step 10: Keep Showing Up

For ongoing marketing, [**Publer.io**](https://publer.io) handles scheduling across X, LinkedIn, and YouTube.  
If I want to grow a professional network, [**Taplio**](https://taplio.com) is a better fit — AI-assisted writing, yes, but human stories still perform best.

Marketing is now part of the build process.  
I post as I code.



## 🧩 Bonus Stack: The Indie10k Formula

Here’s my favorite combo so far: claude+nextjs+vercel+stripe+resend+google analytics = minimal indie saas loop. Everything else is a sweet.

That’s backend, payments, analytics, content and distribution — all in one self-contained, fast stack.



## 💭 Reflection

Every founder ends up rebuilding the same foundation.  
Mine just happens to be simple enough that I can reuse it again and again.

If you’re starting out, don’t collect tools — **collect loops**.  
Tools are only valuable when they help you ship momentum.

You don’t need another tool. You need one more rep.
