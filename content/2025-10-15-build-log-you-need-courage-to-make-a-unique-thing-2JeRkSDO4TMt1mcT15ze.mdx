The truth is — your SaaS core idea might not be unique.
Mine isn’t either.

The heart of **Indie10k** is the same as **Duolingo** or any **fitness app** — small, daily reps that build a long-term habit.
That idea has existed forever.

But what makes something unique isn’t the core.
It’s *where* you apply it.
It’s *how* you reshape it to solve a pain that no one has packaged this way before.

For indie developers, the hardest part isn’t writing code — it’s showing up for growth.
Marketing, selling, talking to users — that’s the real pain.
And that’s where **Indie10k** applies the “daily rep” idea.

It takes courage to do that.
To take something familiar and use it in a space where people don’t expect it.
To face confusion, doubt, and “isn’t that just another tracker?” comments —
and still keep building.

Uniqueness isn’t born from invention.
It’s born from *conviction*.
From daring to apply a known truth in a new, meaningful way.

That’s what I’m building with **Indie10k** —
a growth habit system for indie devs.
It’s not new in form, but it’s new in purpose.
And that takes courage.
