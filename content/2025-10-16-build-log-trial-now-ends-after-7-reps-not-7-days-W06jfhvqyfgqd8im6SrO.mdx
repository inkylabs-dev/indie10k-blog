Today I changed how the Indie10k trial works.
It no longer ends *7 days* after you sign up.
It now ends *after youâ€™ve completed 7 reps.*
### Why this matters

Time urgency isnâ€™t the key to Indie10kâ€™s success.
Rhythm is.

Building in public, validating ideas, writing updates â€” these things donâ€™t always fit a daily timer. Some weeks you sprint. Some weeks you recover. What matters is that you keep coming back.

You can take one rep today, leave for a few days, watch how your project performs, and return for another.
Each rep compounds the last.
Thatâ€™s the belief behind Indie10k â€” helping indie devs build momentum, not guilt.

Itâ€™s not about streaks for the sake of streaks.
Itâ€™s about rhythm.
About returning again and again, because you *want* to.

**Keep going! **
