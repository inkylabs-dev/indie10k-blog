Most founders “validate” by asking for opinions.  
They post polls, tweet feature lists, run fake waitlists — and feel good when people say, _“Cool idea!”_

But opinions are free.  
Payments aren’t.  
And that difference is the whole game.

## The Realization

I used to do what everyone does.  
I ran feedback loops, filled out surveys, and waited for upvotes. It all looked like traction — but when I finally asked someone to pay, silence.

That’s when I saw a post by **[Jack on Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/build-log-0-why-i-m-building-pricewise-pricing-shouldnt-be-a-guessing-game-938cdda2c5?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**, where he wrote:

> “$9/mo feels too low. $29/mo feels risky… We guess. And sometimes, we guess wrong.”

Jack’s building **Pricewise**, a tool to simulate pricing decisions with AI personas — because, as he puts it, _pricing shouldn’t be a guessing game_.  
That line hit hard. I realized I’d been avoiding the only test that mattered: asking for money.

## My 7-Day Price Test

Here’s what I did — and what you can copy in an afternoon:

1.  **Pick one feature.** Not the whole product. Just one piece of clear value.
    
2.  **Assign a price.** I started with $15.
    
3.  **Ask one person.** Literally:
    
    > “Would you pay $15 for this right now?”
    
4.  **Log the result.** “Yes”, “No”, or “Maybe — if it had X.”
    
5.  **Change the number.** Next day: $10. Then $20. Then $30.
    

I did this for seven days.  
By day four, I noticed something — people didn’t argue the number. They asked about outcomes. _“Does this save me an hour a day?”_ meant I was close. _“What does it actually do?”_ meant I wasn’t clear enough yet.

## What the Rejections Taught Me

Every _no_ gave me sharper data than the yes’s.  
It told me:

-   My copy was unclear.
    
-   My value prop didn’t match the pain.
    
-   My pricing anchor was untested.
    

The funny part? The “no’s” rewrote my pitch.  
By the time I hit the second week, I’d moved from explaining _features_ to selling _relief_. And that’s when the first real “yes” came.

## Why This Matters

You don’t need 1,000 signups to find your price point.  
You need one real ask — and the courage to hear “no.”

Price isn’t just a number. It’s a truth serum. It tells you whether your product is solving something real or just interesting.

Even Jack’s AI approach with Pricewise exists because _founders fear asking the question directly_.  
But nothing replaces hearing a human say: _“Yes, I’d pay for that.”_

> Opinions tell you what people think.  
> Price tells you what they believe.

## The Rep

Pick one feature today.  
Set a price.  
Message one real prospect:

> “Would you pay $X for this right now?”

Log the answer. Repeat tomorrow at a new number.  
That’s your price curve — built from truth, not theory.
