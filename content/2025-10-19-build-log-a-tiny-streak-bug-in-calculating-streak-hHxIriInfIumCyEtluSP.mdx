Today I fixed a small but meaningful bug in Indie10k’s streak logic.

The current behavior was:

After 24 hours pass without a rep, your momentum pauses, and your streak breaks.

Sounds fine, right?
But here’s the catch:

A user could do a rep at **12:00 AM on Day 1**, and then another at **11:00 PM on Day 2**.
That’s **47 hours apart**, but it should *still* count as a two-day streak.

Instead, Indie10k treated it as a streak break.
The math wasn't correct, and the logic wasn’t human.

One user noticed this and sent me feedback — and I’m *really glad* they did.
It’s a strong signal that people *care* about their momentum, not just their metrics.

Fixing this wasn’t just a bug patch — it’s a reminder that **habits happen in rhythm, not in rigid timeboxes**.
And that’s what [Indie10k](https://indie10k.com) is all about.
