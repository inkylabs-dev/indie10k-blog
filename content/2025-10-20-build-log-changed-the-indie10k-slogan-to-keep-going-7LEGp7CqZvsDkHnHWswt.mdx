**Keep Going!**

It’s more than a slogan — it’s a mindset.

For every indie dev who’s shipped something, only to stall at

- 
23 users and no feedback,

- 
5 DMs and no replies,

- 
1 failed launch and zero MRR…

this is the moment where most stop.
But the real difference between 0 → 1, 1 → 10, and 10 → 100 users isn’t luck or timing.
It’s persistence.
Momentum.
The ability to keep going — even when you’re not sure if it’s working.

That’s why **“Keep Going!”** now sits at the heart of Indie10k.
It’s short enough to fit on a sticker.
Simple enough to remember when you’re tired.
And strong enough to pull you through the next rep.

**What it means for Indie10k**

Our mission has always been to help indie devs reach $10k MRR — not through grand plans, but daily reps.
Now, everything we design will orbit this phrase:

- 
Streaks = proof you kept going

- 
Reps = action you took

- 
Evidence = progress you can see

- 
Stories = inspiration to keep others going

**My takeaway**

I wanted a slogan that feels like a push from a friend, not a slogan from a brand.
A simple reminder when your metrics dip, when no one signs up, or when motivation runs dry:
You don’t need to go fast.
You just need to **keep going.**

💪 **Keep Going.**
