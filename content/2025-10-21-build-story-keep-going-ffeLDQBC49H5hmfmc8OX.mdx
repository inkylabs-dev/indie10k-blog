### 😩 The Pain

Every indie dev starts with fire.
New idea. Fresh repo. 48 tabs open.
For a week or two — pure momentum.

Then… it fades.

You miss a day.
Then two.
Then you stop opening the project at all.
Not because you don’t care — but because you lost *direction.*
No feedback, no users, no sense of progress.
Just silence and guilt.

That’s the quiet death of most side projects.
Not failure. Not burnout.
Just **stopping.**
### 💡 The Solution

That’s why I built [**Indie10k**](https://indie10k.com) — a *growth gym* for indie developers.

It’s not another tracker, not a productivity app.
It’s a **habit system** that helps you *keep going* — one small rep at a time.

Here’s how it solves the problem:

- 
**One Rep a Day:** Instead of endless tasks, you do one clear, focused move forward.

- 
**Streaks that make sense:** Not “daily grind” streaks — *momentum* streaks that flex with your real life.

- 
**Evidence feed:** You see your progress pile up, visually. That’s your feedback loop.

Each feature answers one pain:

“I don’t know what to do next.” → You get one rep.
“I feel like I’m not improving.” → You see your streak grow.
“I forgot why I started.” → You read your past wins.

It’s not about motivation.
It’s about **momentum that survives low days.**
### ❤️ Why It Matters

Most indie devs don’t fail because of the market.
They fail because they stop showing up.

Indie10k exists to fix that.
To turn “I’ll try again someday” into “I did one thing today.”

Because that one thing compounds — into feedback, users, revenue.
That’s how you reach $10k MRR:
Not in one leap, but in ten thousand tiny reps.
### 🚀 The Takeaway

If you’re stuck between building and quitting,
if you’ve lost your streak,
if you feel invisible —

Here’s your reminder:
**Momentum fades. Discipline doesn’t.**
**Keep Going.**
