Shipped something small but real today? Don’t overthink it — show the work.

People love raw, visual progress more than polished launches. It feels alive.

Take a screenshot of whatever you shipped today —

UI tweak, dashboard, chart, or even just a console log.

Then post it with one honest line:

“Shipped this today to make X easier.”

That’s it. No thread, no launch hype.

Let curiosity do the work.

Track what gets likes or comments — that’s your signal.

It shows what people actually care about.

Start with one post a day this week.

Build the habit → build the audience → build momentum.
