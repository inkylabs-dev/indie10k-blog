I used to wait for motivation.
That spark, that burst of energy that made me *want* to ship something.

But here’s what I’ve learned building [**Indie10k**](https://indie10k.com): motivation is fickle.
Momentum is the real compound interest.

When I ship one small rep — fix a bug, improve a headline, reply to one user — I feel a small win.
That win stacks. Tomorrow’s rep gets easier.
Soon, I’m not chasing motivation; I’m riding momentum.

The days I feel unmotivated?
Those are actually the most important ones.
Because when I ship *anyway*, I keep the streak alive.
Momentum doesn’t care how I feel — it just wants motion.

Indie10k is built around that idea.
You don’t need a big plan, a fancy dashboard, or a productivity ritual.
You just need **one rep a day**.
The rest compounds.
### Rep

Ship one thing today — no matter how small.
Momentum will take care of tomorrow.
