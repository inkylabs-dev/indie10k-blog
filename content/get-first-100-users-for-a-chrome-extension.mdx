If you’re building a browser extension, landing your first 100 users is *not* about virality or ads — it’s about **finding your people**, **getting honest feedback**, and **iterating fast**.  
I’ve built and followed dozens of Indie Hackers who did this for their extensions. Here’s what actually works.

---

## 1. Why the First 100 Users Matter

At around 100 installs, patterns start to form:

- Who installs it (students, marketers, devs)?  
- What features they actually use.  
- What breaks their flow.  
- What convinces them to stay or uninstall.

Those first 100 users give you *real-world telemetry* that analytics alone can’t. They’re the raw feedback that turns a half-baked idea into a product people talk about.

On Indie Hackers, **Anuj Jindal** wrote [*“I got my first 150 users on my Chrome extension”*](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/i-got-my-first-150-users-on-my-chrome-extension-a4046fd106?utm_source=indie10k.com).  
He explains how he posted a simple demo to a few subreddits, replied to every comment, and watched the first 10 → 50 → 150 installs come in. His takeaway:  

> “Most people stop after the launch post. But 80% of installs came from my follow-up comments — not the announcement itself.”

## 2. The Extension Traction Triangle — Offer → Channel → Proof

### Offer: Make a Focused Promise  
A Chrome extension isn’t a “mini-app.” It’s a *workflow enhancer*. Your offer should be crystal clear:

> “We help LinkedIn recruiters copy candidate emails in one click.”  
> “We block distracting sites — but only during meetings.”  

The narrower the offer, the faster you’ll get traction.  

### Channel: Where Your First Users Hang Out  
Forget big ads. The most successful founders found their first users in **niche conversations**:

- Subreddits (r/ChromeExtensions, r/Productivity, r/SEO)  
- Indie Hackers build-in-public threads  
- Product Hunt early-access posts  
- Communities tied to the workflow you improve (e.g., Notion, Figma, Shopify)  

In [*“Got My First 100 Users in 25 Days 🚀”*](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/got-my-first-100-users-in-25-days-3fa8f934c1?utm_source=indie10k.com), the maker broke down channel performance:  
> “Reddit: 60 users, Twitter: 25, Indie Hackers: 10, Discord: 5.”  

Lesson: go deep on one or two channels that match your user’s daily routine.

### Proof: Show Real Usage  
Extensions live or die by trust. People install only when they believe it’s safe and useful.  
Ways to prove that early:

- Add screenshots or a 15-sec GIF in your Chrome Web Store listing.  
- Post micro-updates: “v0.2 adds X, thanks @user123 for reporting Y.”  
- Ask your first 10 users to leave honest reviews.  

Each review compounds discoverability.

## 3. Lessons from Real Chrome Extension Founders

### 🧩 Case A — *150 Users by Talking to Every Commenter*  
[**Anuj Jindal**](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/i-got-my-first-150-users-on-my-chrome-extension-a4046fd106?utm_source=indie10k.com) built a simple productivity extension and grew from 0 → 150 installs by hand-replying to Reddit and Indie Hackers comments.  
**Lesson:** Follow-up engagement drives more installs than the launch post.

---

### ⚙️ Case B — *2 Years to $36 MRR*  
Maker [**Tetrev**](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/ive-been-working-on-my-first-saas-chrome-extension-for-2-years-and-reached-36-mrr-de06d0000e?utm_source=indie10k.com) shared brutal honesty:  
> “I built too long before sharing. When I finally posted, only 3 people cared. The rest came after I started writing small dev logs weekly.”  
**Lesson:** Visibility > perfection. Ship, share, fix, repeat.

---

### 💬 Case C — *Lessons from Building My First Extension*  
[**CorpoCoder**](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/lessons-i-learned-from-building-my-first-chrome-extension-8a64fd4c14?utm_source=indie10k.com) wrote a post-mortem that’s gold:  
> “I didn’t realize how much the Chrome Web Store itself can drive traffic once you hit 100 installs and 3+ reviews.”  
**Lesson:** Early reviews multiply organic reach. Treat them like SEO keywords.

## 4. Step-by-Step Framework to Reach 100 Users

| Week | Focus | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Week 1** | Clarify Offer | Write one line: *Who + What + Outcome*. Validate with 3 people in your niche. |
| **Week 2** | Build MVP | Only one use-case. No settings, no dashboards. |
| **Week 3** | Pre-Launch | Collect 10–20 emails via a simple “notify me” page. Post your concept on Indie Hackers. |
| **Week 4** | Publish | Upload to Chrome Web Store. Optimize icon + screenshots. Ask friends for 3 reviews. |
| **Week 5** | Outreach | Share progress threads, DM early users, fix bugs fast. |
| **Week 6** | Feedback Loop | Release v0.2, thank users publicly, share data: installs + DAU. |
| **Week 7** | Momentum | Re-share updates in your community and show proof of use. |

Repeat this cycle until you hit 100 installs and consistent DAU.

## 5. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Building in silence.** The web store is not your growth channel until you earn reviews.  
- **Too-wide promise.** “Boost productivity” means nothing; “copy Gmail attachments to Notion” does.  
- **No onboarding.** Even a 15-sec tooltip tour helps retention.  
- **Ignoring reviews.** Bad reviews kill conversion faster than bugs.  
- **Skipping screenshots.** People don’t read text; they click on visuals.

---

## 6. Chrome Web Store Optimization Tips (Trust Layer)

- **Title:** Include both keyword + benefit. (“YouTube Summary AI – Instant Video Notes”)  
- **Short Desc:** Start with the *outcome* (“Summarize any video in one click”).  
- **Screenshots:** 3 minimum; one should show it in action.  
- **Category:** Pick the most relevant one — it affects discovery ranking.  
- **Version Updates:** Even “minor fixes” updates tell users you’re alive.  

CorpoCoder notes:  
> “I jumped from 20 to 90 installs in 2 weeks right after adding better screenshots.”

## 7. Quick Traction Checklist

✅ Pre-launch page + first 20 emails  
✅ Chrome Web Store listing with icon + 3 screenshots  
✅ Ask 3–5 friends for initial installs & reviews

## 🪞Reflection

The first 100 users of your extension aren’t just numbers — they’re your co-builders.  
They tell you what to keep, what to kill, and what actually delivers value.  
Anuj Jindal reached 150 installs by simply *showing up every day* in the same threads.  
You can, too.
